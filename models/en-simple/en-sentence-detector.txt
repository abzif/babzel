if abbas keeps up this "macho talk" he will kill potential peace talks and might as well allow hamas (which has probably done a better job at providing for the palestinians) rule the west bank.

interim palestinian leader and the front-runner in the upcoming jan. 9, 2005 presidential election mahmoud abbas talks during his first official campaign speech in the west bank town of ramallah, saturday dec. 25, 2004.
cloaking himself in yasser arafat's legacy, abbas pledged to fulfill palestinian dreams of statehood.
it seems that the palestinian leadership (upcoming) will not be a peace partner with israel.
he is already demanding claims that israel said no to not only the world, but to arafat himself.
listing his priorities, abbas told supporters of the ruling fatah party that he was determined to provide security to his people and continue the struggle against israel's partially completed west bank barrier.
abbas also pledged to resolve the problem of millions of palestinian refugees and their descendants.
abbas, a refugee himself from what is today the northern israeli city of safed, called the refugee issue "very important and very dangerous."

the convergence of views among the more militant sunni muslim clerics of ams and the radical shiites of the sadr movement has been seen before, last spring during the initial us assault on fallujah and during the us attack on mahdi army militiamen in najaf.

washington (reuters) -
u.s. officials have said the plot, thwarted by britain, to blow up several aircraft over the atlantic bore many of the hallmarks of al qaeda.
"we believe this is an ill-advised term and we believe that it is counterproductive to associate islam or muslims with fascism," said nihad awad, executive director of the council on american-islamic relations advocacy group.
which is why he didn't say we're at war with islamic people.
we're at war with islamic fascists.
by using the word "islamic" as an adjective bush was purposely not associating muslims with fascism, hence the qualifier.

wiki media foundation, the group behind the wikipedia online encyclopedia project, said friday that search giant google has volunteered to host some of its content on company servers.
(zd net) it looks like the war between microsoft and google is quickly brewing on the horizon.
microsoft is 4-0 (they took down netscape, suns systems, mac and ibm) and google may be their next target.
google is probably making this move to counter microsoft search using encarta (it's online dictionary).

it is likely, but not certain, that they will be deported to myanmar.
but the news of the arakan rebels is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to growing concern in new delhi over the security of the andaman islands.
reports are circulating in the intelligence community that the andaman islands are not only thick with myanmar rebels.
it has also become an arms depot of the liberation tigers of tamil eelam (ltte), who operate almost freely in the andaman sea.
information pointing in this direction came to light after the december 26 tsunami, which took a heavy toll on the andamans.
correspondents who flocked in to cover the tsunami found they also had another story - the miserable security situation surrounding the indian navy's far eastern naval command, now being established along with india's "blue water navy".
deteriorating security
security problems in the andaman sea are not new, but they have deteriorated during the past few years, in tandem with a deterioration in the security situation in bangladesh, nepal and bhutan, and particularly in the northeastern indian states of manipur, nagaland and tripura.
while the indian army has become rock-solid in the western front, and has developed the capability of withstanding any pakistani adventure in that sector, it has become highly vulnerable in its eastern sector, where its enemy is not a national army but a multitude of secessionist, terrorist and drug-running militants operating between southeast asia and northeastern india through bangladesh.
the andaman sea is a major conduit for this traffic, and the 572 large and small islands that constitute the andaman and nicobar group are a natural transit base.

moreover there are now major covert attempts under way to try and bring back to kabul leading taliban commanders, who have been living quietly in pakistan and have taken no part in the taliban insurgency.
with the taliban failure to disrupt the afghan elections, the militants are even more isolated from the mainstream taliban who want to return home.
until now pakistan has not facilitated such a return and clearly it cannot happen until there is both a pull from kabul and a push from islamabad.
with president karzai certain to win the elections and the demotion of key former northern alliance figures such as general fahim and warlord ismail khan, there is now little reason for moderate taliban leaders to fear reprisals from former northern alliance figures if they return home.
their removal should also provide increased motivation for pakistan to help the return of moderate taliban.
afghan officials welcomed the appointment on october 3 of lt. general ashfaq kiyani as the new isi chief.
kayani is well known and liked in kabul as during the last year he led the pakistani delegation in the tripartite military meetings with the afghan and us military on issues related to border issues.
karzai also has to deal with the stepped up rivalry between india and pakistan in afghanistan.
islamabad accuses new delhi of using its consulates in kandahar and jalalabad to train balochi insurgents who are active in pakistani balochistan.
pakistani officials claim there are as many as 42 raw agents based in kandahar and another 12 in jalalabad.

a state senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage california's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices.
the investigative committee, headed by state sen. joe dunn, d-santa ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the capitol: "the palace coup."
lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the california energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers.
the central question behind the palace coup is whether terry winter, the president of the independent system operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge.
winter defied his own board and gov. gray davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show.
"i don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said dunn.

also, from their own webpage, reasons why nasa is important, in a 5th grade format.
i guess if you are someone not familiar with how nasa benefits our society i can see how one might form the opinion of yheggy-ga.
let me put it this way - if you have watched tv recently, crossed a modern bridge, flown in an airplane, recieved any form of modern medicine, did any mathematics, drove a car, used a cellular phone, etc. then you have somehow directly reaped the rewards which nasa has returned to us.
also nasa has a large outreach program for education, some people believe this is important.

the chinese program's second phase will include spacewalks on future missions and demonstrations of docking and undocking techniques.
the final phase will feature the assembly and operation of a longer-duration space lab.
at least one expert believes china's intentions might include a surprise attempt to circle the moon with astronauts before nasa's planned lunar return.
"the americans would be wise to plan accordingly," said john e. pike, director of the alexandria, va.-based globalsecurity.org, a small national security think tank.
"there is always the possibility they could jam us up, make us look like we are not numero uno," pike said.
during the u.s. and russian lunar race during the cold war, nasa scored an early coup by circling the moon with the apollo 8 crew over the 1968 christmas holidays.
as it turned out, the soviets never made it to the moon.
"(china) could be the second country to do that," pike said.
"they would get in line in front of the russians.
and they would not have to land on the moon to take us down a notch."

paul mccartney said recently that he believes in using magic, and he does lots of charity, thinking that in this way he will compensate for the curse of god that is upon him and that took his wife's life because of his satanism and involvement in black magic.
he thinks he will deceive people in this way, so that the real mccartney will not be perceived.
is the old devil attempting to disguise as good in front of people.
satan deceiving mankind once again, as so many other thousands of times through the centuries....
after the devil began his devastating job from the ghostly "devil's island" through his nine main puppets (beatles-rolling stones), he possessed an endless amount of other schizophrenic bad musician in the afore mentioned island and weakening their conscience with drugs, he made them proclaimers of homosexuality, aversion to religion, destruction of family values, dissipation, mental illness, antisocialism, etc., etc.,
the fact that bad apprentice musicians such as the beatles and the rolling stones achieved such a giant fame that not even the real quality musicians could achieve, was because the forces of satan were behind everything, supporting the process.
this mentally ill humanity, destroyed families, twisted moral values, manifest or repressed homosexuality in human beings, anti natural feminism rebellion, drug addiction, corrupt social outlines, mad youths without direction, non respect to hierarchies, convulsed nations, misanthropy, misogyny, paedophilia, irrational and feeble lasciviousness and all other type of existent aberrations, are due to the vast manoeuvre that satan executed through his main marionettes the beatles and the rolling stones, from the devil's island.
if you wonder why there is misery and curse in your house, it is because you own some l.p, cd or another article related to the cursed by god beatles and rolling stones.
we recommend you to take that curse out of your house throwing away everything related to the devil's main nine puppets....

if space is minimal, or you are keeping him in there to be kept away from other pets, then i can understand why you would choose to keep him there.
there are some things to consider though...
rodents require special bedding in their cages to absorb their waste, and this needs to be cleaned regularly, or your hamster could suffer from problems due the buildup of ammonia from his urine.
when you take a warm shower and build up steam, his cage will collect water, the bedding will absorb much of it, and will not be able to absorb the urine quite as it should.
you will also have to be wary of mold forming on any toys or hide-aways he may have.
you also don't want it getting too warm for him too often.
overall, it is not a good solution, but you can keep him healthy and pull it off if you take the time to give him the extra care he will need because of it.
it may be a problem because the temperature is constantly changing.
i would personally put him somewhere else.

microsoft has not announced there new console yet though it is believed to be in the works.
no matter when you buy you will get a newer version.

are there any new gaming console?
i don't know should i buy ps3 or x-box kinect.
or even n-ds or psp.
i'm a little afraid when i buy ps3 or x-box then a newer version comes out.
( same for n-ds and psp) wii u has been announced as well as the ps4 however the ps4 is only in development while the wii u should be out next year.
microsoft has not announced there new console yet though it is believed to be in the works.
no matter when you buy you will get a newer version.
i feel x-box is a very smooth system i own it like 3 years, its very compatible to previous versions and mostly important i was very comfortable with the user interface and the joystick....coz you dont wana hold a joystick that gives you discomfort.

this cage will hold about 2 - 3 rats.
both are equal length so go for the taller one.
if you use this cage it's best to remove the wire shelves altogether and replace it with hammocks and the like.
i used one of these cages short term for a pet and it wasn't that great to be honest, pretty cheaply made, the door springs are annoying and it doesn't last very well.
here are some better options imo:
these are all a bit more expensive than your choice but if you ebay search the names you may be able to find one second hand...better paying for a second hand one in good condition than a poorly made new one imo.
the first one is much better!
i have this exact cage, bought from the exact ebay user.
its really good and the rat calculater says is big enough for 5 rats, but i would put a maximum of 4 in it really :)
is under tank heating or side tank heating better for a corn snake?

for our comparison we sailed on two similar ships - the carnival liberty and the royal caribbean mariner of the seas.
itinerary both ships go to caribbean islands like jamaica, grand cayman, cozumel, st. thomas, the bahamas and st. martin / st. maarten.
the liberty also visited its private island half moon cay, puerto rico, and grand turk.
the mariner of the seas traveled to its private island coco cay and labadee (the north coast of haiti).
we loved most of the locations that both of the ships visited and don't believe that this should be a distinguishing factor on deciding between the cruise lines.
shows each night there are a variety of shows.
usually you have the main show and some type of entertainment before and perhaps afterward.
we felt that the main shows on the mariner of the seas were better.
on the liberty we liked the comedian and juggling act.
if you love seeing the shows, royal caribbean was better for the main shows and carnival was slightly better for the comedians.

maybe a back brase will help, sometimes my back really gets to me and i've thought about getting one.
with your leg flopping, just try putting all your weight in your heel and hangon with only your legs, holding my leg back helps me with flopping the more it's forward the more it flops :/ work your calf muscles, maybe try standing on the edge of your steps (on the ball of your foot) and balance to strengthen those muscles
you don't want to spend more than $20 and yet you have an expensive hobby like riding horses?
i really can't help you.

live food is also higher in nutritional value than freeze dried.
crickets, silk worms, phoenix worms, and various feeder roaches, like red-lobster, turkistan, and dubia, are good example of staple insects to offer your bearded.
wax worms and meal worms should only be offered as treat items, for variety's sake.
i would highly recommend that you read through some reliable bearded guides to make sure you have everything set up correctly:
http://www.beardeddragon.org/articles/caresheet/?page=1
mm it depends on the size of his tank or cage or whatever you have him in..atleast as far as i'm concerned.
if there are shady areas he can move to (for example a 3x5x4 tank with light on one side) then you can leave it on a full 12-14 hours, if its a small tank and he can't escape the light then 4-6 at most at a time though quite possibly 4-6 hours at a time twice a day.
either way you also need to keep an eye on the temperature if you are using a dry fish tank as uv lights in my experience up the temperature significantly and without proper ventilation it can become an oven.
as to what the light provides it gives uv rays..which is important for health in lizards as it is in humans.
that lady at petsmart is a disgrace to the rest of us petsmart associates... sheesh.

the chiro/acupuncturist will be there to evaluate the horse for wobblers which is often caused by spinal compression and can be confused with epm.
if that is the case then acupuncture isn't going to hurt him.

i think it is wonderfully responsible that you are going into this rescue eyes open and are getting the opinions of qualified professionals (and a bunch of yahoos) before you decide to take this horse on.
i do think some y!a users need to work on their reading comprehension as i can't comprehend how taking a horse in as a rescue and getting it qualified medical treatment is abuse.
worst case scenario you fall in love and after spending thousands of dollars you have to put the horse down.
is that something you are up for?
if so go for it and i'll give you all the moral support i can as you figure out what is up.
it is heartbreaking to try to bring a horse back and then have to put it down, but some horses are worth the risk.
if you feel this guy is worth it then i hope your vet can figure things out.

i've never felt the need to write a review or make a complaint before, but after the way i was spoken to by a member of staff at the kennels (whose name i believe to be mrs closs) i would now not recommend this business to anybody.
if the animals are treated in the same way the customers are treated then this leaves a lot to be desired!
nobody should be spoken to like that regardless of how bad their day may have been or what may be going on in their private lives!
best car dealer in tx
i purchased a nissan from this dealship.
the sales men were very knowledgeable about every aspect of every car we looked at.
they were very patient and helpful from showing the cars to doing the paperwork.
the paperwork was a very easy and smooth.
they tried to run my credit score as less as possible so it won't hurt my score.

which was very expensive.

trek is not so great
only concerned with money
i have been getting my treatments for a few months now and have seen some results but not up to the standards that i was told i should expect.
the people there attempt to come across and professional and nice, but i was disappointed with their customer service.
never miss an appointment because they will charge you the price of a treatment, even if you had an emergency.
it's pretty ridiculous!
they want to squeeze as much as they can from you even if you just got in a car accident!!!!

great sanwiches, great prices
i used to go here almost everyday since i work in the neighbourhood and loved their turkey and meatball sandwiches.
chicken salad salad is great too.
best of all, the staff is quick on their feet and even with long lines, usually serve you in 5 minutes or less.
for the quality, the prices ($4-$6) have to be the best in town.
the staff get to know regulars and do their job very well.
tourists like the other reviewer might not appreciate their efficiency or quality, but i certainly do.
this isn'ta tgif or cafe, its a lunch sandwich place and a good one at that.

new training centre is excellent
the award dance centre has moved from its holderness road site to a new complex on chamberlain road hull.
the new centre has 4 studios planned and now boasts the largest single dance floor area in kingston upon hull.
the classes cover all age and skill ranges, with ballroom, latin, sequence, street, disco, line dancing, ballet, tap & jazz.
we have attended a ward dance centre for over a year and really enjoy the friendly and welcoming way we are taught ballroom and latin as well as the fun filled social dance evening held every saturday evening....
it is not really possible to score this school too highly, we would give it 12 out of 10 and 5 stars across the board steve & anne
the night i drove back home, i found that the rear window has some leakage.
(you can hear the wind while driving on highway.
very likely it needs a new window seal).

friendly, clean and excellent location
the staff was very helpful, and gave us good advice on day and night time activities.
common room was comfortable and clean, very good room to read or relax. –
a great breakfast which was included every morning until 9:30am; yummy fresh parisian croissants.
comfortable and clean beds, a bit noisy when people were coming in late from a night out, but we didn't mind too much as we were also just coming in from a night out!
the location is really stellar!
it is next to gare du nord and a five minute walk to sacre coeur which is excellent for shopping.

i thouhgt it would be out of my price range but they really worked with me and now i couldnt be happier.
jeff and craig are really good at what they do and know exactly how to treat a customer.
definitely go see them!
bait and switch, untrained workers
called the bonanza store 2 weeks ago, before i ripped out 350sqft of ceramic tile... was told i would need a "dual head concrete grinder" to remove thinset and make a nice "finished" look (ready for concrete stain).
was quoted $55 all inclusive of grinder inserts, etc.
no problem, sounded like it's done every day.
will look beautiful.

student-teacher relationships are built on trust.
for example, students must trust that teachers have made appropriate decisions about the structure and content of the courses they teach, and teachers must trust that the assignments that students turn in are their own.
acts that violate this trust undermine the educational process.
in this course, collaboration in your project group (3 or 4 students) is allowed, but should not be abused.

also while at cambridge he formed lifelong friendships with men such as john cam hobhouse, who initiated him into the cambridge whig club, which endorsed liberal politics, [28] and francis hodgson, a fellow at king's college, with whom he corresponded on literary and other matters until the end of his life.
emperor norton
joshua abraham norton (c. 1818 – january 8, 1880), known as emperor norton, was a citizen of san francisco, california, who in 1859 proclaimed himself "norton i, emperor of the united states".
he later expanded his pretense by claiming to be "protector of mexico" as well.
born in england, norton spent most of his early life in south africa.
after the death of his mother in 1846 and his father in 1848, he sailed west, arriving in san francisco possibly in november 1849.
norton initially made a living as a businessman, but he lost his fortune investing in peruvian rice.
after he lost a lawsuit in which he tried to void his rice contract, norton's public prominence faded.

following smetana's nationalist example, dvořák frequently employed aspects, specifically rhythms, of the folk music of moravia and his native bohemia.
dvořák's own style has been described as "the fullest recreation of a national idiom with that of the symphonic tradition, absorbing folk influences and finding effective ways of using them". [1]
antonín dvořák
dvořák displayed his musical gifts at an early age, being an apt violin student from age six.
the first public performances of his works were in prague in 1872 and, with special success, in 1873, when he was aged 31.
seeking recognition beyond the prague area, he submitted a score of his first symphony to a prize competition in germany, but did not win, and the unreturned manuscript was lost until rediscovered many decades later.
in 1874 he made a submission to the austrian state prize for composition, including scores of two further symphonies and other works.
although dvořák was not aware of it, johannes brahms was the leading member of the jury and was highly impressed.
the prize was awarded to dvořák in 1874 [a] and again in 1876 and in 1877, when brahms and the prominent critic eduard hanslick, also a member of the jury, made themselves known to him.
brahms recommended dvořák to his publisher, simrock, who soon afterward commissioned what became the slavonic dances, op. 46.

often overshadowed by san francisco, its larger neighbor lying directly to the west, oakland has in recent years began to step out from under the shadows, playing upon the beautiful highlights of its own and its rise as the multicultural "hipster' city of the bay area.
since the 1960s, oakland has been a hub of radical culture, and is the birthplace of both the black panther party and the hell's angels.
oakland's history in the arts and entertainment arena is notable as well, as oakland has nurtured or been a second home to novelists gertrude stein, jack london, amy tan, and maya angelou; actors meryl streep, mark hamill, bruce lee, and tom hanks; architect julia "butterfly" hill; classical conductor calvin simmons; rappers mc hammer, 2pac, messy marv, and several other notables in the liberal arts and sciences.
oakland as a city reflects the amazing diversity of its residents and long history.
for many visitors, the first place they are likely to visit is downtown, especially if they are in town on business, or simply do not know where to start.
the center of transportation by bart and by bus is there, if one wants to branch out.
and it is as simple as walking in a direction from there, for the first few neighborhoods, since old oakland is along 10th street, just west of broadway.
just east of broadway and continuing north and south is oakland's famous chinatown, and that to get the real essence of "chinatown," oakland rather than san francisco is your best bet.

we show that the form is locally calibrated in ways that show it fitting within different language systems.
finally, we address the question of why all languages should have such a word and why its form should be so similar across languages.
we observe that this item fulfils a crucial need shared by all languages – the efficient signalling of problems of hearing and understanding – and we propose that its form is constrained by selective pressures in a conversational environment that is essentially the same in all languages.

mutation-based testing [1] is a test technique that involves artificially introducing errors into a system under test (sut).
a mutant is a copy of the system in which a change has been done that, in most cases, will lead to a behaviour different than expected.
the different mutants are generated automatically by the application of mutation operators.
in the state of the art, we have found mutation operators, both general purpose and specific to different technologies, languages and paradigms [2–9].
however, these operators are not adequate when trying to test software features associated with specific domains.
in this article, we propose mutation operators specific to the domain of geographic information systems (gis) applications.
these operators reproduce programming errors that are litely to occur during the development of this type of applications.
in addition, we present the implementation of these operators and as proof of concept we apply these operators to two real-world gis applications and we generate the mutants.

apparently, however, galois did not ignore poisson's advice, as he began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison, and continued polishing his ideas until his release on 29 april 1832, [12] after which he was somehow talked into a duel. [8]
galois' fatal duel took place on 30 may. [17]
the true motives behind the duel are obscure.
there has been much speculation as to the reasons behind it.
what is known is that five days before his death, he wrote a letter to chevalier which clearly alludes to a broken love affair. [7]
some archival investigation on the original letters suggests that the woman of romantic interest was a mademoiselle stéphanie-félicie poterin du motel, [18] the daughter of the physician at the hostel where galois stayed during the last months of his life.
fragments of letters from her, copied by galois himself (with many portions, such as her name, either obliterated or deliberately omitted), are available. [19]
the letters hint that mlle. du motel had confided some of her troubles to galois, and this might have prompted him to provoke the duel himself on her behalf.
this conjecture is also supported by other letters galois later wrote to his friends the night before he died.
galois' cousin, gabriel demante, when asked if he knew the cause of the duel, mentioned that galois "found himself in the presence of a supposed uncle and a supposed fiancé, each of whom provoked the duel."

what the moon brings
i hate the moon - i am afraid of it - for when it shines on certain scenes familiar and loved it sometimes makes them unfamiliar and hideous.
it was in the spectral summer when the moon shone down on the old garden where i wandered; the spectral summer of narcotic flowers and humid seas of foliage that bring wild and many-coloured dreams.
and as i walked by the shallow crystal stream i saw unwonted ripples tipped with yellow light, as if those placid waters were drawn on in resistless currents to strange oceans that are not in the world.
silent and sparkling, bright and baleful, those moon-cursed waters hurried i knew not whither; whilst from the embowered banks white lotos-blossoms fluttered one by one in the opiate night-wind and dropped despairingly into the stream, swirling away horribly under the arched, carven bridge, and staring back with the sinister resignation of calm, dead faces.
and as i ran along the shore, crushing sleeping flowers with heedless feet and maddened ever by the fear of unknown things and the lure of the dead faces, i saw that the garden had no end under that moon; for where by day the walls were, there stretched now only new vistas of trees and paths, flowers and shrubs, stone idols and pagodas, and bendings of the yellow-litten stream past grassy banks and under grotesque bridges of marble.

“go away!

hackers attack church of scientology website
sunday, january 20, 2008
wikinews has learned that according to an internet posting made just over 24 hours ago, the church of scientology's website is being attacked by hackers, causing the site to shut down.
the attack was launched on wednesday by a user labelled "anonymous", on the website "insurgency wiki", a spinoff of 4chan.
the "history" section of the site explains, in a satirical fashion, that the incident was prompted by the church of scientology's attempts to remove a promotional video featuring scientologist tom cruise from youtube.
though youtube is complying with the church of scientology's requests to take down the video, other sites such as gawker.com have stated that they will keep hosting the video.
"so far, it's the internet: 1, scientology: 0. but it's a long game." - matthew ingram
writing in a blog post, matthew ingram of the globe and mail dubbed the ongoing conflict involving the church of scientology's attempts to remove the cruise video from the internet: "scientology vs. the internet, part xvii".
he characterized the conflict between the church of scientology and anonymous posters of the cruise video as "another small skirmish in a war that scientology has been waging for almost 15 years, since the early days of newsgroups such as alt.religion.scientology, which posted internal church documents in 1994.

the hegelian definition of aesthetics as the philosophy of art that considers the issue of artistic beauty as its core concern is no more enchanting in our time.
many would agree that the question “what makes an artwork beautiful” plays a minor role in contemporary aesthetics and philosophy of art, where the question has been updated to “what makes an artwork meaningful or valuable?”
two factors might contribute to this situation.
firstly, it is not a coincidence that the loss of interest in the inquiry into artistic beauty coincides with a sea change in the artworld, transformed by new art movements as well as struggles in defining art.
being beautiful is no longer a defining feature of art.
now if “art” itself becomes an open concept or a socially, historically, culturally sensitive notion, then whatever makes an artwork beautiful is unlikely to be something homogeneous and unitary.
secondly, the inquiry into “beauty” experienced a shift of focus from the emphasis on aesthetic properties of the objects to the subjective experience involved in aesthetic appreciation.
in other words, a shift from an inquiry about “the beauty of object” to the issue of “the pleasure of beauty.”

isfahan (persian: اصفهان, also known as esfahan) is a city in central iran, south of tehran and is the capital of isfahan province.
the persians call it "nesf-e-jahan", meaning "half the world".
due to its beautiful hand-painted tiling and magnificent public square, it is considered to be one of the most beautiful cities in the world.

some are within 5 – 10 minutes walking distance from the nearest parking lot, some require at least 3 – 4 hours of hiking (those are, of course less frequented by other tourists and you might find yourself alone at a spectacular waterfall in the middle of nowhere - an amazing experience!).
the local rum distilleries offer tours (check for opening times as they may very from season to season) which are certainly worth the while since rum production is a very integral part of guadeloupe's economy.
and sampling the local rums is definitely worth the while.
even though they might not be the best way to get around the island, a ride on the bus is still an experience you should not miss.
cheap, full of locals, conducted by fearless drivers, you can enjoy the beautiful caribbean panorama to the sound of guadeloupean zouk music.

łódź today
since the fall of communism in poland, łódź has not enjoyed the rapid economic growth cities like kraków, warsaw and wrocław have experienced, and has had to endure the fall of much of its textile industry, rising unemployment and emigration (within poland and abroad).
this led to further dilapidation of the investment-starved city, and many of its streets and buildings show profound signs of neglect.
at first glance, for a city of 760,000 and agglomeration of 1.428,000, there does not seem to be much to see.
however, the situation is rapidly changing now with łódź campaigning and redesigning itself as an up-and-coming destination.
to accomplish this, łódź has been capitalizing on its film history - łódź is jokingly referred to as the "hollyłódź" of poland and hosts several film festivals and many other cultural events.
łódź today may not have the glitz and glamour of its heyday; however, there is a certain charm to łódź in its partially renovated façades and leitmotivs, not to mention its grand artistic traditions.

you can group based on the first n characters of the individual items.
for example, you can group the lastname field by first letter to create groups, such as a, b, and so on.
you can specify the start and end values for the grouping range.
custom grouping in pivottable view
for example, you can select from the promotions row field all the promotions that run for a specific period and create a group.
this would add a new row field named promotions 2 above the promotions row field with two members: group1 and other.
you can change the caption of group 1 to fixed and promotions 2 to category in the properties dialog box.
the other group will contain all items that you did not include in the fixed custom group.

for example, the count function returns a count of all the records without null values.
if you want to find the total number of records including those with nullvalues, use count with the wildcard character.
to count null values when using the other aggregate functions, use the nz function, which converts null values to zeroes so they are included in a calculation.

users with an office 2002 license can also create, design, and modify components in a design environment such as microsoft frontpage or microsoft access.
users who do not have office 2002 licenses can view the components and the data in them, and can print the view of the components, but they can not interact with the components or manipulate them in a design environment.

in 1947 copeland had been sent to damascus ("by whom is not stated," kedourie says) "to make unofficial contact" with syrian leaders and "to probe for means of persuading them, on their own, to liberalize their political system."
spreading democracy over the world, the americans first fought rigged elections in syria, but the old corruption continued despite all their power and money could do.
frustrated, the americans decided for the best of reasons, as always, to make a heavier move:
this was not considered particularly bizarre; other american ambassadors and ministers in the arab world were entirely in favor of "genuine" revolution to overthrow old landowners, rich crooks, and politicians.
"what was wanted was an elite to underpin the rulers, themselves in turn supported and buttressed by a population which presumably understood, approved, and legitimated the aims of such an elite.
whoever knows the middle east will agree that such a quest was the political equivalent of the search for the philosophical stone."
failing in syria, the americans went to work in egypt.
the americans wanted the new regime to make the populace literate, to create "a large and stable middle class a sufficient identification of local ideals and values, so that truly indigenous democratic institutions could grow up."

transport safety has sadly been in the news recently:
needless to say, safety on roads, railways and inland waterways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, training for safety advisors should also be harmonised, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new adr, for example, which is under way.
this is not just the fault of the commission, but i believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.
i can live with these minimum standards, but i would ask the commission to monitor the situation very carefully.
but i believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.
i hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow's vote.
i would like to ask the vice-president if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations, and whether the eu is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts, in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible.
mr president, i would very much like to thank mrs schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that i am speaking for my colleague, mrs flautre, who followed this for the committee on employment and social affairs but who is unfortunately ill.
but the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted, as the idea of linking social fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme.
the truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the commission must take account of what is adopted by this parliament, particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives.

they need to see the political dimension working, to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens.
this is what we are today asking the commissioner for.
i would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional president, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.
mr president, i support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the structural funds and the cohesion fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following:
member states are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas.
this process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the eu leaders at their berlin summit last year, which were supported by parliament at its last may plenary part-session.

for him, a federal system is a means for the kremlin to make political mischief and ultimately incorporate ukraine's eastern and southern regions into the russian federation.
to paraphrase clausewitz, federalism for putin is annexation by other means.
one has only to look at the russian proposal's fine print:
ukraine's new federal units would have a powerful say over "ukraine's foreign-policy direction.

this made him the object of ridicule among his much wealthier schoolmates.
as a result, he was frequently sent to the "alcove," a punishment cell reserved for disobedient students.
balzac worked these scenes from his boyhood-as he did many aspects of his life and the lives of those around him-into la comédie humaine.
"he devoured books of every kind, feeding indiscriminately on religious works, history and literature, philosophy and physics.
he had told me that he found indescribable delight in reading dictionaries for lack of other books.
"balzac often fell ill, finally causing the headmaster to contact his family with news of a "sort of a coma".
when he returned home, his grandmother said:
"look how the academy returns the pretty ones we send them!
" balzac himself attributed his condition to "intellectual congestion", but his extended confinement in the "alcove" was surely a factor.
(meanwhile, his father had been writing a treatise on "the means of preventing thefts and murders, and of restoring the men who commit them to a useful role in society", in which he heaped disdain on prison as a form of crime prevention.)

the wit and wordplay of much ado about nothing, the charming rural setting of as you like it, and the lively merrymaking of twelfth night complete shakespeare's sequence of great comedies.
this period begins and ends with two tragedies:
romeo and juliet, the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and death;
and julius caesar — based on sir thomas north's 1579 translation of plutarch's parallel lives — which introduced a new kind of drama.
according to shakespearean scholar james shapiro, in julius caesar "the various strands of politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even shakespeare's own reflections on the act of writing, began to infuse each other".
many critics believe that shakespeare's greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art.
the titular hero of one of shakespeare's most famous tragedies, hamlet, has probably been discussed more than any other shakespearean character, especially for his famous soliloquy which begins "to be or not to be;
unlike the introverted hamlet, whose fatal flaw is hesitation, the heroes of the tragedies that followed, othello and king lear, are undone by hasty errors of judgement.
the plots of shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves.
in othello, the villain iago stokes othello's sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him.

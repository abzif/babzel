the results of the february 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487mmbtu.
in addition, there is a reduction of 22,101mmbtu which is the difference between the scada values (best available) that anita showed on the february 29th storage sheet and the "official" february 29th values that gary wilson received from mips.

bush asked for permission to go to alabama to work on a senate campaign.
his superior officers said ok.
requests like that weren't unusual, says retired col. william campenni, who flew with bush in 1970 and 1971.
"in 1972, there was an enormous glut of pilots," campenni says.
"the vietnam war was winding down, and the air force was putting pilots in desk jobs.
in '72 or '73, if you were a pilot, active or guard, and you had an obligation and wanted to get out, no problem.
in fact, you were helping them solve their problem."
so bush stopped flying.
from may 1972 to may 1973, he earned just 56 points - not much, but enough to meet his requirement.

... the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal, music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story.
almost all of the avant guard art movements of the early 20th century (except for italian futurism) were labeled 'degenerate' by the national socialists.
adolf hitler even held an exhibition of 'degenerate art' in 1937, while curating a parallel show of 'aryan' art across the street.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/degenerate_art
ironically (or perhaps not), the notion of the 'degenerate' and 'degenerate art' was appropriated by the nazis and its origins can be traced back to jewish 'intellectual' max nordau and a 1892 book he authored called degeneration. .
nordau was also the co founder of the world zionist organization.

my goal, however optimistic, is to execute the risk policy by the end of today.

therefore, i need to know asap if there are any problems with the draft as written.
otherwise, i will be sending it to peoples as our final revision by mid morning.
thanks for your prompt attention to this.

it's got its own bathroom and tv, and is pretty cozy.
as far as the call with uncle ben goes, if he was thrilled to hear from me i couldn't tell by his voice.
it was a pretty stilted conversation for both of us.
but, i guess, it's a start...
i've already made my xmas plans.
i leave the evening of the 21st, my flight comes in about 10 pm, and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am.
it's good chatting with you.

hey tonto (a.k.a - the trusty, but silent, side-kick to the lone ranger or in this case the big d)
the play was very good and i think well received.
i'd forgotten how blown away i was by some of the songs the first time i saw it in ny.
the cast members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of the most poignant numbers ( i think this could be your true calling).
i caught the third day of corey's jeopardy run last night here at the office (yes, i had to come back after the play...i love my job!).
anyway, i'm sure i'd mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl.
as a result of that, she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my enjoyment of playing trivial pursuit or watching jeopardy by absolutely obliterating me (the girl actually did her senior thesis on trivia).
kori told me she saw you last night at steak night and introduced herself since i failed to do so the last time we went.

thanks for your help!

if you need more, there is a proposal from the documentation committee for a new alternative for calculating termination amounts (we heard about it in amsterdam) that i think will be particularly attractive to the energy markets.
i don't know where this stands officially (i haven't heard any developments since amsterdam) but i can find out from bob pickle if you want.

* offers a 7.5 cent/dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate changes to other customers, minimizing the incentive for these customers to seek to bypass local transmission charges and other cpuc-approved charges. *
* adopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in gas commodity markets, and identifies the capital projects needed to meet these guidelines over the course of the ga ii period (2003-2007). *
* provides a high degree of rate stability, with a 3.5% escalator to capture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects.
the guaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or catastrophic events. *
* preserves a rate differential between the redwood and baja paths, although somewhat less than the current differential. *
* proposes a two-stage open season for firm transportation services beginning in 2003, with end users receiving a first option on available capacity. *
* maintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments.
pg&e also anticipates that the core procurement incentive mechanism (cpim) will be similar to today's mechanism, but will reflect the somewhat larger capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to meet a 1-day in 10-year cold weather event.
this also will serve as a reminder that an all-party meeting is scheduled at pg&e's headquarters in san francisco on january 10 and 11, to discuss this proposal and to respond to your questions.
we look forward to answering your questions and receiving your feedback.

"all hell broke loose.''
records show that on oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the federal energy regulatory commission, demanding that the new plan be killed.
the letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators.
"if not removed immediately, the (iso) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by duke energy vice president william hall iii.
although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials.
he said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws.
in the oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market.
the generators got their way.
the next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan.
what was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier.

the family here (california) wanted to fly any family members from there to ca, so they could remain here until things got straightened out down there.

1. blowback in iraq
the recent elections in iraq were dominated by an amalgam of religiously fundamentalist shi'ite organizations, principally the dawa party and the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq (sciri).
both dawa and sciri have umbilical connections to the fundamentalist shi'ite leadership in iran that go back decades.
in essence, iran now owns a significant portion of the iraqi government.
should the united states undertake military action against iran, the ramifications in iraq would be immediate and extreme.
in the first eight days of january, eighteen us troops have been killed in iraq, compounded by another twelve deaths from a black hawk helicopter crash on saturday.
much of the violence aimed at american forces is coming from disgruntled sunni factions that have their own militias, believe the last elections were a sham, and hold little political power in the government.

well, t.v. is a series of flickering pictures that are streamed together to make a moving picture.

to a dog, watching t.v. is a lot like watching and old scratchy silent film because their flicker fusion seems to occur at a rate of 70 to 80hz.
so they see the pictures flicker slower and there for it seems choppy to them.

i went home at lunch to check on him and he is doing 1000etter he was actually walkin around and wagin his tail :) thanks everbody for the info its greatly appreciated.
to answer your questions in order:
1) it is not normal for dogs to be vomiting, much less to have blood in it.
however, if they have been vomiting numerous times, then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines.
he could also have parvovirus, a gi foreign body, or any number of things.

however, if they have been vomiting numerous times, then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines.
he could also have parvovirus, a gi foreign body, or any number of things.

hi there,
please choose the parakeet...
heres my reason.....
i did the same thing that you did for christmas.
i ended up getting a pair of zebra finches for christmas.
at first it was all cool and all.
they were chirping and doing their every day business.
after a couple of weeks i got tired of them.
they are quite messy and you cannot hold or pet them.
ive tried to tame them and they just would not get tamed.

oil change disaster my wife had taken her '07 ford fusion in for a routine oil change.
a couple days after the oil change, the engine ran rough, the low oil pressure light would come on sporadically, and the engine would whir loudly.
turns out the engine had no oil, and when oil was put it, it would just run out of the filter.

didn't hurt any that they knew my name by my second visit and greeted me warmly then and on my third visit.
whereas my answer to the question "where do you get your laundry done?" used to be, "at the checkout line at walmart," i can honestly say the answer now is, "at the laundry tub."
thank you!
i recently took a rescue puppy to this clinic and i was shocked at how well romeo and my family was treated.
they worked around the clock to ensure that my puppy life was saved.
we have to leave him at the vet for 3 days and i was told to call for check ups as often as i wished that no matter how many times i called i would not annoy them.
lol they where super friendly towards us and treated us like people not walking bags of cash.
in this day its rare to find such wonderful people who care , not the kind of want to make cash.
i would strongly suggest you give them the chance to prove to you that not all people in this world are evil!
i will never go to another vet as long as i have animals.

2. we really liked the fact that stuart sets defined objectives and we meet once a month to go over our key performance indicators.
how has it gone so far?
well we have been working with ulistic for 1.5 months, and have 100 people following our site on facebook, and our web site, www.designofashion.com has seen a 3 fold increase in traffic, which is significantly beating our expectations - seo is a process that takes time and to get results this quickly is exceptional.
we are absolutely confident that stuart's ethical and focused strategies will see these trends continue to grow, and our business will reap the rewards of this program.
finally, it must be said that stuart is a fantastic person to work with, because of his solid strategies and equally as importantly because he is a genuinely good person and a great communicator.
excellent service and quality

in fact, substantial periods (months to years) of limited or no exposure following l2 training are not uncommon, and may even be the norm [16].
such a scenario may be found in different situations, including when one studies a language in a classroom and then stops taking classes [17], [18] and when one is immersed in a foreign language setting and then moves away [19].
in the present study, we examine the outcomes of such a period of no exposure on the neurocognition of l2 grammar: that is, whether a substantial period of no exposure leads to decreased proficiency and/or less native-like neural processes ("use it or lose it" [20]), no such changes, or perhaps whether even higher proficiency and/or more native-like processing may be observed.
additionally, we test whether any such outcomes might vary as a function of the type of l2 training, in particular between classroom-like and immersion-like contexts.
previous research
we are aware of six studies designed to investigate the effects of a substantial period of limited exposure following adult l2 training [17], [18], [21]-[24], all of which were restricted to the examination of behavioral (performance) outcomes.
(note that we do not consider case studies, purely observational data, or research on l2s acquired by children; for a comprehensive review, see [16]).
the six studies tested l2 learners after periods of 1 month to 50 years of limited l2 exposure, mainly on general language skills [17], [18], [21], [23], [24], though also on more specific paradigms meant to target aspects of grammatical abilities [17], [18] or lexical abilities [22], [23].
these language measures were compared in most studies to the same measures in a different set of subjects who had not experienced a period of limited exposure [17], [18], [22], [23], or to retrospective ratings of the same subjects [21], with only one longitudinal study testing the same subjects before and after a period of limited exposure [24].
across the studies, the periods of limited exposure followed either classroom training [17], [18], [22], [24] or mixed classroom and immersion training [21], [23], [24].

as he dismounted in front of the house i heard my mother whispering: "protect us, god with the black-and-white tail, from that which is not of this earth."
my father dismounted from his mule and strutted toward us, grinning.
i thought i caught an odor off him, of fish, sea-sickness and sweat.

then we stood, unable to keep from staring at the stranger, who faced us awkwardly, half-smiling, taller than any man there.

what results are two completely separate reviews of "the rains of castamere" which in turn document the fans' reactions to the episode in the form of user comment threads:
one comment thread where fans were expected to be shocked by the outcome of the episode and one comment thread where fans had hotly anticipated it.
as a pilot project, the current work takes the content of both comment threads - a corpus of approximately 5,600 comments - and analyzes each thread separately using a qualitative coding method aligned with constructivist grounded theory (charmaz, 2006).
through this analysis, a categorization of themes emerges illustrating tactics for negotiating intertexts and paratexts unique to each group of fans.
these themes fall under two broad categories:
negotiation (i.e., emotional responses) and tactical negotiation (i.e., cognitive, or reasoned responses).
conclusion
the present research represents a first step in exploring the impact of transmedia systems, as exemplified by game of thrones, through the study of fans.
the question posed by this research is, fundamentally, an examination of how the problem of "access" is framed in postdigital society from the perspective of the consumer.
future research should explore the negotiation tactics observed in transmedia fans using the principles of de certeau's (1984) everyday life practice, in order to extend its application to the broader context of modern-day consumers.

what first attracted you to researching ants?
me and a studymate were keeping a lot of animals during our studies, from beetles, to butterflies and mantids, to ants.
we had the ants in an observation nest, and i could just look at them for hours, watching them go about.
this was in my third year of biology study i think.
after a while i needed to start thinking about an internship for my m.sc. studies, and decided to write a couple of professors.
i ended up going to the centre for social evolution at the university of copenhagen where i did a project on learning in ants under supervision of prof. patrizia d'ettorre.
i liked it so much there i ended up doing a phd and i've been working on social insects ever since.
what methods and equipment were used for this investigation?
this is a fun one.

do you think this is a revival of the left in the west?

it's really hard to tell.
i mean there's certainly signs of it, and in the united states too, in fact we had a sit down strike in the united states not long ago, which is a very militant labor action.
sit down strikes which began at a significant level in the 1930's were very threatening to management and ownership, because the sit down strike is one step before workers taking over the factory and running it and kicking out the management, and probably doing a better job.
so that's a frightening idea, and police were called in and so on.
well we just had one in the united states at the republic windows and doors factory, it's hard to know, i mean these things are just hard to predict, they may take off, and they may take on a broader scope, they may fizzle away or be diverted.

it was three years between recovery of specimens and final publication, why did it take so long?
you mean, how did we manage to make it all happen so quickly, right? :)
it was about two years from when frank sent me specimens to when we got the paper out.
some of that time was just lost time - i had other projects in the queue that i needed to finish.
once we figured out what it was, we played a lot of manuscript email tag, which can be challenging and time consuming given the differing schedules that folks keep in terms of travel, field work, etc.
manuscript review and processing took about four months.
what sort of difficulties were posed by the unorthodox preservatives used, and what additional work might be possible on a specimen with intact dna?
the preservation was not unorthodox - they followed best practices for anatomical preservation.
having dna-suitable material will let us see whether there are new genes, or genes turned on in different ways and at different times that help explain how these animals burrow into hard ice and then survive in the cold.

hundreds dead in hajj stampede

the plains of arafat on the day of hajj
according to the saudi interior ministry over 345 muslim pilgrims have been killed in a stampede during the annual hajj pilgrimage near mecca, saudi arabia.
the stampede at islam's most holy site happened at jamarat bridge, during an event where pebbles are thrown at a pillar to represent the stoning of satan as part of the final rites of the hajj.
the stampede began when luggage from a bus tripped pilgrims at the eastern end of the wall, causing a bottleneck.
those who were tripped were then crushed by the wave of people behind them.
muslims are required to make a pilgrimage to mecca during their lifetimes, if physically or financially possible, as it is one of the five pillars of the islamic faith.
saudi officials had already provided safeguards by installing an oval wall with padded edges to protect pilgrams from a crush, installed security cameras and placed over 60,000 security personnel in the area.

finally, i should like to point out here the significance of a proposal put forward by our colleague edouard des places.
i see this proposal as establishing some sort of precedent.
it was quite a poignant fact that i was away on that particular friday.
i would certainly not want farmers in countries that do not want to join the euro to be penalised.
a strong euro will therefore penalise european agricultural exports.
under these conditions, what will the future of the rural areas of europe be like as a consequence?
we in the committee on agriculture and rural development feel that this form of production should be encouraged.
too little is being done in this area. more needs to be done, but we must avoid creating more bureaucracy.
i have nothing against putting quality goods on the world market when it is a matter of competition.

there's another top predator in the ocean, it turns out.
and we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places.
this is whale meat that i photographed in a grocery store in tokyo - or is it?
in fact, what we did a few years ago was learn how to smuggle a molecular biology lab into tokyo and use it to genetically test the dna out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were.
and some of those whale meat samples were whale meat.
some of them were illegal whale meat, by the way.

False positives: {
females after their first calf is already weaned: those females, they're not trying to.

many of his novels were initially serialized, like those of dickens.
illusions perdues extends to a thousand pages after starting inauspiciously in a small-town print shop, whereas la fille aux yeux d'or (the girl with the golden eyes, 1835) opens with a broad panorama of paris but becomes a closely plotted novella of only fifty pages.
he then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee.
he would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch;
he claimed to have once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle.
balzac revised obsessively, covering printer's proofs with changes and additions to be reset.
he sometimes repeated this process during the publication of a book, causing significant expense for both himself and the publisher.
as a result, the finished product was frequently quite different from the original book.
while some of his books never reached a finished state, some of those - such as les employes (the government clerks, 1841) - are nonetheless noted by critics.
he was friends with theophile gautier and pierre-marie-charles de bernard du grail de la villette, and he knew victor hugo.

the early plays were influenced by the works of other elizabethan dramatists, especially thomas kyd and christopher marlowe, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of seneca.
the comedy of errors was also based on classical models, but no source for the taming of the shrew has been found, though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story.
like the two gentlemen of verona, in which two friends appear to approve of rape, the shrew's story of the taming of a woman's independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics and directors.
a midsummer night's dream is a witty mixture of romance, fairy magic, and comic lowlife scenes.
shakespeare's next comedy, the equally romantic merchant of venice, contains a portrayal of the vengeful jewish moneylender shylock, which reflects elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences.
the wit and wordplay of much ado about nothing, the charming rural setting of as you like it, and the lively merrymaking of twelfth night complete shakespeare's sequence of great comedies.
this period begins and ends with two tragedies:
romeo and juliet, the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and death;
and julius caesar - based on sir thomas north's 1579 translation of plutarch's parallel lives - which introduced a new kind of drama.
according to shakespearean scholar james shapiro, in julius caesar "the various strands of politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even shakespeare's own reflections on the act of writing, began to infuse each other".

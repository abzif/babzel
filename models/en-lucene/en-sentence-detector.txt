new york's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in november rose 60 cents to close at 66.80 dollars per barrel.
in london, the price of brent north sea crude for november delivery advanced 53 cents to 64.73 dollars.
after brushing the florida keys islands on tuesday, rita packed winds of about 240 kilometers an hour as it headed across the gulf of mexico.
the us national hurricane center said rita was "extremely dangerous" and could become a top-level category five storm on the saffir-simpson scale.
the storm threatened oil installations in the gulf of mexico where about one-quarter of us oil operations are based.
oil companies evacuated offshore facilities as the storm's progress kept global markets on tenterhooks.

the correction to the working gas includes two corrections.
the results of the february 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487mmbtu.
in addition, there is a reduction of 22,101mmbtu which is the difference between the scada values (best available) that anita showed on the february 29th storage sheet and the "official" february 29th values that gary wilson received from mips.
to summarize: enron's pad gas will now be 3,993,310mmbtu, instead of 4,223,000mmbtu.
enron's working gas will be reduced by 420,588mmbtu.

and this has already drawn protests from the tamil national alliance (tna) which was backed by the ltte in the april general elections held in sri lanka.
"tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between india and sri lanka would encourage sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process," tna member of parliament p sithamparanathan was quoted as saying in a statement.
she added that recent visits to the island by india's top military brass including army chief general nirmal chander vij have "caused apprehension among tamils that preparations are under way for another war in the island".
but kalkat pointed out that india would be ill-advised to be involved again, militarily, with sri lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic tamils in the indian state of tamil nadu - separated from sri lanka's jaffna peninsula by the narrow palk straits.
apart from the 1,200 indian lives lost in 1987, the indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in tamil nadu and the jaffna peninsula but also among the sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country's sovereignty.
the best option, now, under the present difficult circumstances is for colombo to do its own dirty work, although new delhi can always be counted on to render good neighborly help because of the shared belief that religion, ethnicity and language cannot be the basis for secession.
in any case, kalkat puts it succinctly: "there cannot be a military option to what is a political situation."
asia times online 16/11/2004
unreported by the international media, the valley of kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural genocide that has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the hindu families who have been living there since human habitation was first recorded.
over nine dozen temples that had served the hindu population have been destroyed, with some used as building material and others as urinals.

asia times online 16/11/2004 unreported by the international media, the valley of kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural genocide that has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the hindu families who have been living there since human habitation was first recorded.
over nine dozen temples that had served the hindu population have been destroyed, with some used as building material and others as urinals.

one unnamed naval officer was quoted saying, "arms smuggling is a very profitable business in this region."
considering the islands' huge strategic importance, it is amazing how lax new delhi has been.
these islands sit aside the vital sea lanes of the strait of malacca, through which 300 tankers and merchant ships pass daily, bringing in oil for the far east and southeast asia.
intelligence lapses
as the implications of the andaman islands situation sink in, indian intelligence has inevitably come under scrutiny.
in recent months, its fallibility has become evident.
the inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro-india political leader and former bangladeshi prime minister sheikh hasina wazed last august 21 at a political rally in dhaka, and the recent "coup" by nepalese king gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy, are glaring examples of intelligence failure.
with growing economic and military power, india will be dependent on smaller nations in the region increasingly to maintain regional security.
unless new delhi does better in providing security to its own nationals against rebels, secessionists, drug runners and arms traffickers, it will not generate much confidence in the capitals of surrounding nations.
in fact, it would tend to encourage more organized anti-india outfits, such as the pakistani inter-services intelligence (isi) and outside-linked maoists, to exploit these networks and weaken india's eastern flank.

michele tollis, fabio's father, began to attend metal concerts and festivals across europe, handing out leaflets and quizzing fabio's friends.
fabio and his friends were into the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal, music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story.

also, i'm quite clear on the fact that those in power now (and, in general, most anyone at the top of a pyrimidal power structure) tend to use the dominant religion as a cloak to hide their true motivations and as a tool to control the masses.
it boggles the mind that anyone can take at face value bush's claims to be a christian, yet many seem to do just that.

he will make sure that we do not request fx and inflation (cpi,ppi, etc.) curves when only one of the curves will actually be used in the valuation process and to determine which inflation index is needed.
typically, we receive both fx and inflation from you, but both curves may not always be used.
i hope that we can give you some time savings by eliminating any nonessential requests.
for now, this is the list of countries for which we will probably need the fx and/or inflation curves.

in one sense it's great, but it also makes things a lot harder to read.
anyway, i'm sure my mom told you guys but travis and kathy got to meet him and i think it went well.
hopefully, if we're still dating come december, you and chuck can meet him when you come back to visit.
i'm planning on dragging him to at least one of the u.t. games, i just have to find out when he wants to go (as well as properly prepare him for the scott/kelley/parks/wild card gang and the full-day affair that is a u.t. game).
things in houston are good and definitely warm.
i went with emily and her mom last night to see the musical "rent" and it was wonderful.
also, i'm going out to san diego for the labor day weekend to visit hoot's daughter julie.

that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses, as400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to aa within the audit timetable)
an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see mo work )
the creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards ) for key metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to meet the above stated objectives
the signoff for additional permanent 'enron' headcount who will 'duplicate' certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing traffic staff
a reconciling difference of $15mm exists between the reported dpr and the final accounting p&l as generated on the as400.
we will continue to investigate potential misstatements in the system p&l, as a result of data or system valuation problems, within the month end reporting timeframe.
however, this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and signoff of system p&l values with traders.
the recall of all obsf stock in early april and retention on balance sheet ( reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated.
middle office work being prioritised is as follows
the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23rd - with full reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic/co-ordination an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30th ( replacing planned 23rd review due to system issues ), requiring full download of contract detail for later reference

the guaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or catastrophic events. *
* preserves a rate differential between the redwood and baja paths, although somewhat less than the current differential. *
* proposes a two-stage open season for firm transportation services beginning in 2003, with end users receiving a first option on available capacity. *
* maintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments.
pg&e also anticipates that the core procurement incentive mechanism (cpim) will be similar to today's mechanism, but will reflect the somewhat larger capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to meet a 1-day in 10-year cold weather event.
this also will serve as a reminder that an all-party meeting is scheduled at pg&e's headquarters in san francisco on january 10 and 11, to discuss this proposal and to respond to your questions.

so now the senate is getting ready to vote soon, on whether to approve him or not; and at this moment (evening of jan. 27, 2006) it looks like he has more than the fifty-one votes needed for approval.
the president is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote, because he very much wants to have samuel alito on the supreme court, to be judging the cases bush is interested in.
so there is a lot of hurry-up pressure on the senate to give its prompt vote of approval.
there is an old saying that applies in this situation: "act in haste, repent at leisure."
sometimes you can make a bad decision very quickly, then regret it for many years to come.
that is what is about to happen with judge samuel alito, in my opinion, because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of supreme court justice: he does not really agree with the system of "checks and balances" built into the constitution, and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the "unitary executive theory," which calls for vastly-increased presidential power at the expense of congress and the supreme court.

boulder, co, nov. 15 (upi) --
scientists can argue all they want about how many degrees celsius -- or fahrenheit -- the planet is warming and what the trend portends, but meanwhile earth's plants, insects and animals are not waiting for the outcome.
they already are altering their patterns of behavior in response to what is happening.
it turns out one of the surest barometers of the warming climate is the response of the non-human natural world to changing conditions, and biologists who study the responses have been aware for some years the biosphere is acknowledging global warming.
nina leopold bradley, a plant ecologist and daughter of the conservation pioneer aldo leopold, published a 1999 paper in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences on her 61-year uninterrupted phenological records.
phenology studies an organism's development and life cycle -- the pulse of life.
bradley's record of 300 phenophases found that even prior to 1999, spring was arriving in higher latitudes several weeks earlier than in the earlier years of her data.

3. the syrian connection
in february of 2005, iran and syria agreed upon a mutual protection pact to combat "challenges and threats" in the region.
this was a specific reaction to the american invasion of iraq, and a reaction to america's condemnation of syria after the death of lebanese prime minister rafik hariri, which was widely seen as an assassination ordered from damascus.
an attack on iran would trigger this mutual defense pact, and could conceivably bring syria into direct conflict with american forces.
like iran, syria's military is nothing to scoff at.
virtually every credible analysis has syria standing as the strongest military force in the middle east after israel.
damascus has been intent for years upon establishing significant military strength to serve as a counterweight to israel's overwhelming capabilities.
as of 2002, syria had some 215,000 soldiers under arms, 4,700 tanks, and a massive artillery capability.
the syrian air force is comprised of ten to eleven fighter/attack squadrons and sixteen fighter squadrons, totaling somewhere near 650 aircraft.
syria also possesses one of the largest arsenals of ballistic missiles in the region, comprised primarily of scud-derived systems.

how much should i be looking at for horse transportation?
i need one horse transported to shows throughout the 2012 show season, and the location is about 3 hours away from where i live.
the place where i'm boarding is not likely to want to take me this far, and i do not have any ways of hauling him myself.
so i want to hire someone (or multiple people) to transport me to these shows.
if they ask how much i'm willing to pay, what is a good price range?
i saw a site that charges $0.70 per mile.
is that reasonable?

brass has an even higher melting point than bronze and i would think your charcoal just doesn't get hot enough.

i have done a fair amount of metal casting, but never tried to build my own furnace, but i think your version is just too small and doesn't get hot enough.
i have melted small amounts of bronze in a crucible with a large propane torch (much larger than the plumbers torch, but it can be run of those propane cylinders you can buy for a gas grill).
i melt brass and cast it http://www.mikegigi.com/castgobl.htm
brass melts at just under 2000f which is a bright yellow heat, not red hot.

you might be able to make a version of your setup work, but it would take quite a bit of charcoal and a lot of forced air.

not surprisingly, most of the yearly festivals occur during these times so as to take advantage of the crowds and the more favourable weather.
spring (february to april) and autumn (august to october) make good alternatives, although the country's ever-growing popularity as a tourist destination can often blur the lines between mid- and high-season tourism.
still, you have a better chance of some peace and quiet, and the weather can be surprisingly better in april and september than in mid-july - again, it's all part of the uncertainty principle.
spring festivities include the ever-popular st patrick's festival.
although temperatures do not often venture below freezing, winter (december to february) can be brutal, for huge parts of the country - the west and northwest in particular.
crowds are at their thinnest, but many of the country's tourist attractions and services close down in october and don't reopen until easter, which paradoxically leaves visitors with a more convincing taste of how ireland is experienced by most of the irish: it's cold, grey and dark by 5pm, but there's always a pub to escape into when the rain starts sheeting down.
the thing to do is to bring the right clothing with you, clothes so you can layer up if it is cold and take off layers when it warms up.
waterproof clothing and footwear are essential plus an umbrella..
as that famous scotsman billy connolly says "there is no such thing as bad weather just the wrong clothes"
afraid i cannot be more helpful, it is really a case of pot luck, although as the weather is so changeable often a cold wet morning will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa.

you will also have the experience of learning the bella sicilian culture, that i have fallen in luv with.
i will 4-ever be eternally grateful for their hospitality and luv that my sicilian family showed me when i was there for 3 years.
luv always..
i've never felt the need to write a review or make a complaint before, but after the way i was spoken to by a member of staff at the kennels (whose name i believe to be mrs closs) i would now not recommend this business to anybody.
if the animals are treated in the same way the customers are treated then this leaves a lot to be desired!
nobody should be spoken to like that regardless of how bad their day may have been or what may be going on in their private lives!

he doesn't just take pictures he makes art out of them and you won't even notice that there's a camera there.
not so great
my husband just got a bike there as a gift he's only had it a month.
it's a nice bike and it cost a lot of money.
but just this week a peddle broke.
he took it back and they would not honor a warranty and said it was his fault because of his shoes??
so they were going to charge him for new peddles and proceeded to put them on without even telling him the price.
which was very expensive.
he asked for a different pair instead and they only gave him five dollars off??
trek is not so great

all of the pho places taste the same to me, so what seperates one from the other is the service and the price.
the service here is incredible compared to the other places.
the only down fall of this pho house is the difficulty in finding parking in chinatown.
remember to bring cash since they don't take debit or credit.
hope this helps!!
had a horrible experience with a manager here, rachel mcinnis, she was rude, inconsiderate and did not do the right thing for an item that was marked incorrectly...
i'm not interested in shopping in a place with people like her... she refused to sell me the item at its marked price even after admitting they had made a mistake.
i normally don't write reviews but seeing that i considered dillards a distinguished, upscale place to shop, this one won't be getting my business, nor my family's, nor my co-workers.
it's never ok to let a customer walk out unhappy, especially when they are right.
highly recommend

i have never had any problems with loud neighbors or concerns about safety.
the apartments are within walking distance to trader joe's, whole foods, and other stores.

then we got put in a room with a huge gap under the door....right next to the ice machine.
we could hear every single thing that happened outside like it was inside our room.
when i finally found someone at the desk who could speak english, they moved our room, but we still did not receive the single queen we had "reserved"
i was thoroughly impressed!
i had a problem with the tile in my bathroom coming apart.
i called a few different businesses in the area to get estimates , they weren't the cheapest i found but very reasonable.
the best part is i got my whole bathroom remodeled for about the same price the other company's were quoting just to fix the shower tile and fixtures.
they had the work done in about half the time quoted which made me and my wife extremely happy.
we have had nothing but compliments on our bathroom when guest come over- who would have guessed that one?

first of all, if you call for an appointment they won't tell you to call back a month later so you can then make one.
they also don't tell you that they're going to mail you an "application" to be admitted to be a patient.
i feel that the way some doctors offices work around here is a little bit absurd so i'm happy that these guys don't do those two things in particlular.
usually you can be seen the same week or maybe the following week.
the doctor did tell me that my male pattern baldness is due to my mothers father because the gene is exclusively passed on through maternal line but that's a common misconception (http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm).

it sounds (according to your own statement) that they had a roomful of dogs, so they must be doing something right - and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems.
you say you work a lot, and that you have a young dog; so i have little doubt that your dog is just filled with energy to burn; and it is good of you to look for a place to take him.
but not at a risk to other people's pets.
you were clearly given another alternative by second home, to board him - which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from second home a couple times, getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later.
no business is going to push customers away without good reason; so isn't it reasonable to think they might know what they're doing?
my dogs are far from perfect, and one of them i believe would be a little much for daycare here herself (at least initially).
be a little more reasonable with your expectations of a place like this; and maybe don't jump to personal attacks suggesting that they don't want to work hard, just because you bruised your own ego.

identify possible subjects, based on experience, a comparison of existing teaching material related to dh (e.g. the programming historian, the digital scholarship training programme at the british library and columbia university's developing librarian project) and the tadirah taxonomy of research activities;
get feedback from researchers on possible subjects, based on the knowledge and skills they feel librarians need;
get feedback from librarians on possible subjects, based on already known gaps in their knowledge and skills.
with these in hand, we will design the curriculum of clinics, based on the method of 'constructive alignment' (biggs et al., 2011), to make sure that the intended learning objectives and the teaching/learning activities stay aligned.
our plan is to organize a maximum of 6 clinics, each one full day.
each day starts with one or more lectures by researchers, that address the conceptual knowledge needed.
the afternoon sessions will be devoted to the hands-on training of skills, following the library carpentry model as closely as possible.
by having researchers provide the lecture sessions, we hope to fuel the enthusiasm of the librarians with the inspiration of direct contact with researchers and to provide access to a network within and across universities.
with these clinics, we hope to initiate a stream of dh activities in dutch universities, making access to support easier for new digital scholars.

homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine which treats patients with massively diluted forms of substances that, if given to a healthy person undiluted, would cause symptoms similar to the disease.
typical treatments take the dilutions, with ritualised shaking between each step of the dilution, past the level where any molecules of the original substance are likely to remain; for homeopathic treatments to work, basic well-understood concepts in chemistry and physics would have to be wrong.
there is no evidence that homeopathy is more effective than placebo for any condition.
australian children suffering from iodine deficiency
thursday, february 23, 2006
almost half of all australian primary school children are mild to moderately iodine deficient, researchers say.
a new study documenting iodine nutritional status in australian school children has revealed many are not getting enough iodine - which can lead to mental and growth retardation.
the report's authors say iodine deficiency is "the sleeper health issue in australia", and potentially a very serious one.
the results of the australian national iodine nutrition study published in the medical journal of australia this week, revealed that children in mainland australia are borderline iodine deficient.
the report has prompted calls for all edible salt to be iodised.

this process of synoikismos - bringing together in one home - created the largest and wealthiest state on the greek mainland, but it also created a larger class of people excluded from political life by the nobility.
by the 7th century bc, social unrest had become widespread, and the areopagus appointed draco to draft a strict new law code (hence "draconian").
when this failed, they appointed solon, with a mandate to create a new constitution (594).
this was the great beginning of a new social revolution, which was the result of the democracy under clisthenes (508 bc).
during the middle ages, athens experienced a decline, but re-emerged under byzantian rule.

1 introduction
tenured and tenure-track university faculty play a special role in determining the speed and direction of scientific progress, both directly through their research and indirectly through their training of new researchers.
past studies establish that each of these efforts is strongly and positively influenced through various forms of faculty diversity, including ethnic, racial, and gender diversity.
as an example, research shows that greater diversity within a community or group can lead to improved critical thinking [1] and more creative solutions to complex tasks [2, 3] by pairing together individuals with unique skillsets and perspectives that complement and often augment the abilities of their peers.
additionally, diversity has been shown to produce more supportive social climates and effective learning environments [4], which can facilitate the mentoring of young scientists.
despite these positive effects, however, quantifying the impact of diversity in science remains exceedingly difficult, due in large part to a lack of comprehensive data about the scientific workforce.
measuring the composition and dynamics of a scientific workforce, particularly in a rapidly expanding field like computer science, is a crucial first step toward understanding how scholarly research is conducted and how it might be enhanced.
for many scientific fields, however, there is no central listing of all tenure-track faculty, making it difficult to define a rigorous sample frame for analysis.
further, rates of adoption of services like googlescholar and researchgate vary within, and across disciplines.

repair is initiated not by the speaker of the first turn but by the other participant ("other-initiated"), and the repair initiator signals that there is a problem, but it leaves open what the problem is ("open") [11].
the actual repair operation in response to this interjection is usually simply repetition, sometimes with slight modification.

we describe the process for applying the operators and generating mutants, and present a case study where these mutation operators are applied to two real-world applications.
keywords: mutation operators; geographic information systems; mutation testing
1. introduction
mutation-based testing [1] is a test technique that involves artificially introducing errors into a system under test (sut).
a mutant is a copy of the system in which a change has been done that, in most cases, will lead to a behaviour different than expected.
the different mutants are generated automatically by the application of mutation operators.
in the state of the art, we have found mutation operators, both general purpose and specific to different technologies, languages and paradigms [2-9].
however, these operators are not adequate when trying to test software features associated with specific domains.
in this article, we propose mutation operators specific to the domain of geographic information systems (gis) applications.
these operators reproduce programming errors that are litely to occur during the development of this type of applications.

in fact you can ask questions about why it should ever have existed, but now why should it exist.
i mean the theory was, whether you believe it or not, that it would be a defensive alliance against potential soviet aggression, that's the basic doctrine.
well there's no defense against soviet aggression, so whether you believe that doctrine or not that's gone.
when the soviet union collapsed there had been an agreement, a recent agreement, between gorbachev and the u.s government and the first bush administration.
the agreement was that gorbachev agreed to a quite remarkable concession: he agreed to let a united germany join the nato military alliance.

after calling the scientology organization by phone to attempt to speak with his mother, montalvo was instead put through to a scientology attorney, kendrick moxon.
rathbun wrote, "moxon proceeded to lie to daniel that the hard drives were never returned, and made a convincing case (not difficult to do with a 19 year old who does not even know the three branches of government) that daniel would be put behind iron bars for a good long time, unless of course, he returned and cooperated with moxon and routed out properly."
to "route out" in scientology jargon refers to the member who wishes to leave proceeding through a set of interrogative exit interviews while attached to the scientology device called the e-meter.
according to rathbun, a detective for the los angeles sheriff's office was provided with material from scientology to build a case against montalvo.
rathbun stated,
"daniel was picked up by an investigator in a black car with blacked out windows.
instead of being taken to a hotel, where he could route out as promised, he was taken to the century city towers.
he was deposited in an office on the 33rd floor where a pricy church lawyer interrogated him for two hours."
rathbun asserted that scientology officials, "... plied the sheriff's detective with a grand conspiracy theory, characterizing me as the 'anti-christ' of the church of scientology. ... the next thing daniel knows he's in a cell where he sat for the next 30 hours."
steve whitmore, a representative for the la sheriff's office, told la weekly in a statement that the case involving montalvo was being dealt with as charges relating to grand theft.

however, in the mid-1980s, cleveland earned the nickname the "comeback city" as the urban core experienced a dramatic revitalization process that continues today.
as its "comeback" has continued, the official moniker is now the new american city as cleveland has rightfully earned the reputation as a model of effective public-private partnership for urban planning.
despite the common perception that cleveland is an industrial town, just beyond the automotive and steel plants, a clean and beautiful downtown rises at the mouth of the cuyahoga river on the southern shore of lake erie (often marvelled over by visitors who are surprised you can't see the other side, i.e., canada).
like other cities in the so-called "rust belt", cleveland has endured growing pains as it makes its transition from a manufacturing-based economy.
while cleveland continues to play a leading role in building the u.s. industrial base, it has also developed economic prowess in the fields of health care, law, finance, insurance, real estate development, and professional services.

another thing non-locals don't often realize is that cleveland's long history of industrial wealth has left it chock full of cultural riches as well as the beginnings of a "sustainable city" movement.

phoenix is extremely hot and dry in the summertime, so always have sunscreen with you!
understand
why would anybody want to start a city in the middle of a desert?
the answer is, surprisingly, agriculture.
the salt and verde rivers of central arizona were exploited for large-scale agriculture by native americans as early as the 11th century.
the area that now encompasses phoenix was a center of the hohokam culture, which built large canal systems and a network of towns and villages, whose remains may be viewed in the city to this day.
white settlers discovered the remnants of the hohokam culture in the 19th century.
the city's name reflects its history as a city "reborn from the ashes" of the previous settlement.
european-american settlement of the area commenced in the 1860s, and in 1911 the completion of the first of several large reservoirs in the mountains north and east of phoenix insured its success as a center for irrigation-based agriculture.
many tens of thousands of acres were planted in citrus and cotton and other crops, and for many years, intensive, year-round irrigated agriculture formed the basis of the economy.

about handling null values in calculations
the aggregate functions won't include records containing blank (null) values in their calculations.
for example, the count function returns a count of all the records without null values.
if you want to find the total number of records including those with nullvalues, use count with the wildcard character.
to count null values when using the other aggregate functions, use the nz function, which converts null values to zeroes so they are included in a calculation.

i hope that the commission is able to accept the present amendment.
mr president, i would like to thank not only mr koch, but also the vice-president of the commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority.
for one thing is clear:
we all regret that the european committee for standardisation (cen) has not been able, in the required time, to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the european union.
this debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this europe of ours.
a moment ago, mr vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures, not of 20 degrees below zero, but of 40 degrees below zero.
of course, we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and i believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the european union, which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature.
i would like to say, with regard to mr swoboda's comments on the activity of the cen, that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if, despite the new deadline, we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded.
the commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, mr koch, which are contained in the various amendments, specifically four.
we therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed.

they need to see the political dimension working, to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens.
this is what we are today asking the commissioner for.
i would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional president, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.
mr president, i support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the structural funds and the cohesion fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following:
member states are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas.
this process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the eu leaders at their berlin summit last year, which were supported by parliament at its last may plenary part-session.
key eu programmes between 1989, 1993, 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and objective 1 regions within europe.

there's no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pile of indigestible styrofoam peanuts.
and that's exactly what happens with pcbs in this food pyramid:
they accumulate into the top of it.
now suppose, instead of styrofoam peanuts, we take these lovely little chocolates that we get and we had those instead.

Predicted: {
because when we jam things in the bottom of that pyramid that shouldn't be there, some very frightening things happen.
now, to bring that home, i thought i'd invent a little game.
we don't really have to play it; it's the styrofoam and chocolate game.

london - bank of england governor mark carney surprised his audience at a conference late last year by speculating that banking assets in london could grow to more than nine times britain's gdp by 2050.
his forecast represented a simple extrapolation of two trends:
continued financial deepening worldwide (that is, faster growth of financial assets than of the real economy), and london's maintenance of its share of the global financial business.
these may be reasonable assumptions, but the estimate was deeply unsettling to many.
hosting a huge financial center, with outsize domestic banks, can be costly to taxpayers.
in iceland and ireland, banks outgrew their governments' ability to support them when needed.
the result was disastrous.
quite apart from the potential bailout costs, some argue that financial hypertrophy harms the real economy by syphoning off talent and resources that could better be deployed elsewhere.
but carney argues that, on the contrary, the rest of the british economy benefits from having a global financial center in its midst.
"being at the heart of the global financial system," he said, "broadens the investment opportunities for the institutions that look after british savings, and reinforces the ability of uk manufacturing and creative industries to compete globally.

china's rebalancing will enable it to absorb its surplus savings, which will be put to work building a social safety net and boosting chinese households' wherewithal.
as a result, china will no longer be inclined to lend its capital to the us.
for a growth-starved us economy, the transformation of its codependent partner could well be a fork in the road.
one path is quite risky:
the other path holds great opportunity:
in doing so, the us could draw support from exports, especially to a rebalanced china - currently its third-largest and fastest-growing major export market.
compared with other emerging economies, china is cut from a different cloth.
china emerged from the late-1990's asian financial crisis as the region's most resilient economy, and i suspect the same will be true this time.
malthus, marx, and modern growth.
cambridge - the promise that each generation will be better off than the last is a fundamental tenet of modern society.

"this reality was noted by playwright oscar wilde, who said:
i remember it when i laugh.
one critic explained that "there is a center and a circumference to balzac's world.
"balzac's use of repeating characters, moving in and out of the comedie's books, strengthens the realist representation.
"when the characters reappear", notes rogers, "they do not step out of nowhere;
they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see.
"he also used a realist technique which french novelist marcel proust later named "retrospective illumination", whereby a character's past is revealed long after she or he first appears.
a nearly infinite reserve of energy propels the characters in balzac's novels.
struggling against the currents of human nature and society, they may lose more often than they win - but only rarely do they give up.
balzac spoke often of a "nervous and fluid force" between individuals, and raphael valentin's decline in la peau de chagrin exemplifies the danger of withdrawing from the company of other people.

in some cases, for example hamlet, troilus and cressida and othello, shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions.
in the case of king lear, however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the 1623 folio version is so different from the 1608 quarto, that the oxford shakespeare prints them both, arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion.
in 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of plague, shakespeare published two narrative poems on erotic themes, venus and adonis and the rape of lucrece.
in venus and adonis, an innocent adonis rejects the sexual advances of venus;
while in the rape of lucrece, the virtuous wife lucrece is raped by the lustful tarquin.
influenced by ovid's metamorphoses, the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust.
both proved popular and were often reprinted during shakespeare's lifetime.
a third narrative poem, a lover's complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition of the sonnets in 1609.
most scholars now accept that shakespeare wrote a lover's complaint.
critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects.

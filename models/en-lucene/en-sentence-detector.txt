the storm threatened oil installations in the gulf of mexico where about one-quarter of us oil operations are based.
oil companies evacuated offshore facilities as the storm's progress kept global markets on tenterhooks.

the correction to the working gas includes two corrections.
the results of the february 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487mmbtu.
in addition, there is a reduction of 22,101mmbtu which is the difference between the scada values (best available) that anita showed on the february 29th storage sheet and the "official" february 29th values that gary wilson received from mips.
to summarize: enron's pad gas will now be 3,993,310mmbtu, instead of 4,223,000mmbtu.
enron's working gas will be reduced by 420,588mmbtu.

and this has already drawn protests from the tamil national alliance (tna) which was backed by the ltte in the april general elections held in sri lanka.
"tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between india and sri lanka would encourage sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process," tna member of parliament p sithamparanathan was quoted as saying in a statement.
she added that recent visits to the island by india's top military brass including army chief general nirmal chander vij have "caused apprehension among tamils that preparations are under way for another war in the island".
but kalkat pointed out that india would be ill-advised to be involved again, militarily, with sri lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic tamils in the indian state of tamil nadu - separated from sri lanka's jaffna peninsula by the narrow palk straits.
apart from the 1,200 indian lives lost in 1987, the indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in tamil nadu and the jaffna peninsula but also among the sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country's sovereignty.
the best option, now, under the present difficult circumstances is for colombo to do its own dirty work, although new delhi can always be counted on to render good neighborly help because of the shared belief that religion, ethnicity and language cannot be the basis for secession.
in any case, kalkat puts it succinctly: "there cannot be a military option to what is a political situation."

over nine dozen temples that had served the hindu population have been destroyed, with some used as building material and others as urinals.

and this has already drawn protests from the tamil national alliance (tna) which was backed by the ltte in the april general elections held in sri lanka.
"tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between india and sri lanka would encourage sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process," tna member of parliament p sithamparanathan was quoted as saying in a statement.
she added that recent visits to the island by india's top military brass including army chief general nirmal chander vij have "caused apprehension among tamils that preparations are under way for another war in the island".
but kalkat pointed out that india would be ill-advised to be involved again, militarily, with sri lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic tamils in the indian state of tamil nadu - separated from sri lanka's jaffna peninsula by the narrow palk straits.
apart from the 1,200 indian lives lost in 1987, the indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in tamil nadu and the jaffna peninsula but also among the sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country's sovereignty.
the best option, now, under the present difficult circumstances is for colombo to do its own dirty work, although new delhi can always be counted on to render good neighborly help because of the shared belief that religion, ethnicity and language cannot be the basis for secession.
in any case, kalkat puts it succinctly: "there cannot be a military option to what is a political situation."

one unnamed naval officer was quoted saying, "arms smuggling is a very profitable business in this region."
considering the islands' huge strategic importance, it is amazing how lax new delhi has been.
these islands sit aside the vital sea lanes of the strait of malacca, through which 300 tankers and merchant ships pass daily, bringing in oil for the far east and southeast asia.
intelligence lapses
as the implications of the andaman islands situation sink in, indian intelligence has inevitably come under scrutiny.
in recent months, its fallibility has become evident.
the inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro-india political leader and former bangladeshi prime minister sheikh hasina wazed last august 21 at a political rally in dhaka, and the recent "coup" by nepalese king gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy, are glaring examples of intelligence failure.
with growing economic and military power, india will be dependent on smaller nations in the region increasingly to maintain regional security.
unless new delhi does better in providing security to its own nationals against rebels, secessionists, drug runners and arms traffickers, it will not generate much confidence in the capitals of surrounding nations.
in fact, it would tend to encourage more organized anti-india outfits, such as the pakistani inter-services intelligence (isi) and outside-linked maoists, to exploit these networks and weaken india's eastern flank.

they had been drinking at a pub called the midnight - the centre of the heavy metal scene in milan - and they never came home.
the police and many of their friends just thought they had run off together.

michele tollis, fabio's father, began to attend metal concerts and festivals across europe, handing out leaflets and quizzing fabio's friends.
fabio and his friends were into the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal, music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story.

true believers are dangerous animals.
i just get hung up on 'christians', as they're the dominant form where i come from.
also, i'm quite clear on the fact that those in power now (and, in general, most anyone at the top of a pyrimidal power structure) tend to use the dominant religion as a cloak to hide their true motivations and as a tool to control the masses.
it boggles the mind that anyone can take at face value bush's claims to be a christian, yet many seem to do just that.
i seem to remember something about 'by their works shall ye know them."

andre is going to look over the list of curves needed for the global assets (august board meeting) one more time before i forward it to you.
he will make sure that we do not request fx and inflation (cpi,ppi, etc.) curves when only one of the curves will actually be used in the valuation process and to determine which inflation index is needed.
typically, we receive both fx and inflation from you, but both curves may not always be used.
i hope that we can give you some time savings by eliminating any nonessential requests.
for now, this is the list of countries for which we will probably need the fx and/or inflation curves.

it's funny, because usually it's just me, mom, craig and danelia, and danelia doesn't really like roasted turkey or roast beef (not that she would say it to me!), so there is not just the same joy in cooking it would be elsewise.
it was good having the girls down.

Predicted: {
i'm working on it now.
maybe we (enron) could review it tomorrow morning, then send it to fce.
i can meet around 10:00.
that way, we can get it to them in time for weekend review.
does that work?
kay it was good to hear from you!

as much fun as they are, i figured we would probably do some different things than what you have planned for them.
as for ted, things are still going well although i haven't see him at all this week (we are two very busy people).
but, we had a great laid back day last saturday and i think have hit that comfortable stage...you know, not quite so formal about dates etc.
in one sense it's great, but it also makes things a lot harder to read.
anyway, i'm sure my mom told you guys but travis and kathy got to meet him and i think it went well.
hopefully, if we're still dating come december, you and chuck can meet him when you come back to visit.
i'm planning on dragging him to at least one of the u.t. games, i just have to find out when he wants to go (as well as properly prepare him for the scott/kelley/parks/wild card gang and the full-day affair that is a u.t. game).
things in houston are good and definitely warm.
i went with emily and her mom last night to see the musical "rent" and it was wonderful.
also, i'm going out to san diego for the labor day weekend to visit hoot's daughter julie.

that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses, as400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to aa within the audit timetable)
an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see mo work )
the creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards ) for key metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to meet the above stated objectives
the signoff for additional permanent 'enron' headcount who will 'duplicate' certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing traffic staff
a reconciling difference of $15mm exists between the reported dpr and the final accounting p&l as generated on the as400.
we will continue to investigate potential misstatements in the system p&l, as a result of data or system valuation problems, within the month end reporting timeframe.
however, this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and signoff of system p&l values with traders.
the recall of all obsf stock in early april and retention on balance sheet ( reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated.
middle office work being prioritised is as follows
the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23rd - with full reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic/co-ordination an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30th ( replacing planned 23rd review due to system issues ), requiring full download of contract detail for later reference

the guaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or catastrophic events. *
* preserves a rate differential between the redwood and baja paths, although somewhat less than the current differential. *

pg&e also anticipates that the core procurement incentive mechanism (cpim) will be similar to today's mechanism, but will reflect the somewhat larger capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to meet a 1-day in 10-year cold weather event.
this also will serve as a reminder that an all-party meeting is scheduled at pg&e's headquarters in san francisco on january 10 and 11, to discuss this proposal and to respond to your questions.

where is the "simple" explanation of the transportation piece?

president bush loves him.
yes, it is true that some people don't like the way they think he will vote on the supreme court.
but other people do like the way they think he will vote, and the ones who favor him seem to outnumber the ones who oppose him.
so now the senate is getting ready to vote soon, on whether to approve him or not; and at this moment (evening of jan. 27, 2006) it looks like he has more than the fifty-one votes needed for approval.
the president is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote, because he very much wants to have samuel alito on the supreme court, to be judging the cases bush is interested in.
so there is a lot of hurry-up pressure on the senate to give its prompt vote of approval.
there is an old saying that applies in this situation: "act in haste, repent at leisure."
sometimes you can make a bad decision very quickly, then regret it for many years to come.
that is what is about to happen with judge samuel alito, in my opinion, because he has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of supreme court justice: he does not really agree with the system of "checks and balances" built into the constitution, and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the "unitary executive theory," which calls for vastly-increased presidential power at the expense of congress and the supreme court.
and because of this tragic flaw . . .

boulder, co, nov. 15 (upi) --
scientists can argue all they want about how many degrees celsius -- or fahrenheit -- the planet is warming and what the trend portends, but meanwhile earth's plants, insects and animals are not waiting for the outcome.
they already are altering their patterns of behavior in response to what is happening.
it turns out one of the surest barometers of the warming climate is the response of the non-human natural world to changing conditions, and biologists who study the responses have been aware for some years the biosphere is acknowledging global warming.
nina leopold bradley, a plant ecologist and daughter of the conservation pioneer aldo leopold, published a 1999 paper in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences on her 61-year uninterrupted phenological records.
phenology studies an organism's development and life cycle -- the pulse of life.
bradley's record of 300 phenophases found that even prior to 1999, spring was arriving in higher latitudes several weeks earlier than in the earlier years of her data.

3. the syrian connection
in february of 2005, iran and syria agreed upon a mutual protection pact to combat "challenges and threats" in the region.
this was a specific reaction to the american invasion of iraq, and a reaction to america's condemnation of syria after the death of lebanese prime minister rafik hariri, which was widely seen as an assassination ordered from damascus.
an attack on iran would trigger this mutual defense pact, and could conceivably bring syria into direct conflict with american forces.
like iran, syria's military is nothing to scoff at.
virtually every credible analysis has syria standing as the strongest military force in the middle east after israel.
damascus has been intent for years upon establishing significant military strength to serve as a counterweight to israel's overwhelming capabilities.
as of 2002, syria had some 215,000 soldiers under arms, 4,700 tanks, and a massive artillery capability.
the syrian air force is comprised of ten to eleven fighter/attack squadrons and sixteen fighter squadrons, totaling somewhere near 650 aircraft.
syria also possesses one of the largest arsenals of ballistic missiles in the region, comprised primarily of scud-derived systems.

how much should i be looking at for horse transportation?
i need one horse transported to shows throughout the 2012 show season, and the location is about 3 hours away from where i live.
the place where i'm boarding is not likely to want to take me this far, and i do not have any ways of hauling him myself.
so i want to hire someone (or multiple people) to transport me to these shows.
if they ask how much i'm willing to pay, what is a good price range?
i saw a site that charges $0.70 per mile.
is that reasonable?

brass has an even higher melting point than bronze and i would think your charcoal just doesn't get hot enough.

i have done a fair amount of metal casting, but never tried to build my own furnace, but i think your version is just too small and doesn't get hot enough.
i have melted small amounts of bronze in a crucible with a large propane torch (much larger than the plumbers torch, but it can be run of those propane cylinders you can buy for a gas grill).

brass melts at just under 2000f which is a bright yellow heat, not red hot.

you might be able to make a version of your setup work, but it would take quite a bit of charcoal and a lot of forced air.

not surprisingly, most of the yearly festivals occur during these times so as to take advantage of the crowds and the more favourable weather.
spring (february to april) and autumn (august to october) make good alternatives, although the country's ever-growing popularity as a tourist destination can often blur the lines between mid- and high-season tourism.
still, you have a better chance of some peace and quiet, and the weather can be surprisingly better in april and september than in mid-july - again, it's all part of the uncertainty principle.
spring festivities include the ever-popular st patrick's festival.
although temperatures do not often venture below freezing, winter (december to february) can be brutal, for huge parts of the country - the west and northwest in particular.
crowds are at their thinnest, but many of the country's tourist attractions and services close down in october and don't reopen until easter, which paradoxically leaves visitors with a more convincing taste of how ireland is experienced by most of the irish: it's cold, grey and dark by 5pm, but there's always a pub to escape into when the rain starts sheeting down.
the thing to do is to bring the right clothing with you, clothes so you can layer up if it is cold and take off layers when it warms up.
waterproof clothing and footwear are essential plus an umbrella..
as that famous scotsman billy connolly says "there is no such thing as bad weather just the wrong clothes"
afraid i cannot be more helpful, it is really a case of pot luck, although as the weather is so changeable often a cold wet morning will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa.

they are and always will be the nicest people in sicily that you will meet.
you will also have the pleasure of learning the italiano language.
you will also have the experience of learning the bella sicilian culture, that i have fallen in luv with.
i will 4-ever be eternally grateful for their hospitality and luv that my sicilian family showed me when i was there for 3 years.
luv always..
i've never felt the need to write a review or make a complaint before, but after the way i was spoken to by a member of staff at the kennels (whose name i believe to be mrs closs) i would now not recommend this business to anybody.
if the animals are treated in the same way the customers are treated then this leaves a lot to be desired!
nobody should be spoken to like that regardless of how bad their day may have been or what may be going on in their private lives!

he doesn't just take pictures he makes art out of them and you won't even notice that there's a camera there.
not so great
my husband just got a bike there as a gift he's only had it a month.
it's a nice bike and it cost a lot of money.
but just this week a peddle broke.
he took it back and they would not honor a warranty and said it was his fault because of his shoes??
so they were going to charge him for new peddles and proceeded to put them on without even telling him the price.
which was very expensive.
he asked for a different pair instead and they only gave him five dollars off??
trek is not so great

all of the pho places taste the same to me, so what seperates one from the other is the service and the price.
the service here is incredible compared to the other places.
the only down fall of this pho house is the difficulty in finding parking in chinatown.
remember to bring cash since they don't take debit or credit.
hope this helps!!
had a horrible experience with a manager here, rachel mcinnis, she was rude, inconsiderate and did not do the right thing for an item that was marked incorrectly...
i'm not interested in shopping in a place with people like her... she refused to sell me the item at its marked price even after admitting they had made a mistake.
i normally don't write reviews but seeing that i considered dillards a distinguished, upscale place to shop, this one won't be getting my business, nor my family's, nor my co-workers.
it's never ok to let a customer walk out unhappy, especially when they are right.
highly recommend

great service, great pricing and super convenient!
i also did not feel like they tried to sell me a bunch of services that i did not need.
love my home at creekside
i moved to creekside apartments in august 2008 with a 6-month lease and have just extended it for another 13 months!
the management from julie and janice to the work staff, esp. edwin, are just wonderful.
they have been extremely helpful whenever i have asked for help.
although the apartments are facing stokes street and close to the bascom light rail, the location is surprisingly quiet.
i have never had any problems with loud neighbors or concerns about safety.
the apartments are within walking distance to trader joe's, whole foods, and other stores.

since they consider this an upgrade, they let their other rooms fill up and would not change our room.
then we got put in a room with a huge gap under the door....right next to the ice machine.
we could hear every single thing that happened outside like it was inside our room.
when i finally found someone at the desk who could speak english, they moved our room, but we still did not receive the single queen we had "reserved"
i was thoroughly impressed!
i had a problem with the tile in my bathroom coming apart.
i called a few different businesses in the area to get estimates , they weren't the cheapest i found but very reasonable.
the best part is i got my whole bathroom remodeled for about the same price the other company's were quoting just to fix the shower tile and fixtures.
they had the work done in about half the time quoted which made me and my wife extremely happy.
we have had nothing but compliments on our bathroom when guest come over- who would have guessed that one?

first of all, if you call for an appointment they won't tell you to call back a month later so you can then make one.
they also don't tell you that they're going to mail you an "application" to be admitted to be a patient.
i feel that the way some doctors offices work around here is a little bit absurd so i'm happy that these guys don't do those two things in particlular.
usually you can be seen the same week or maybe the following week.
the doctor did tell me that my male pattern baldness is due to my mothers father because the gene is exclusively passed on through maternal line but that's a common misconception (http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm).
in general i would say that the staff is attentive and nice.

each day starts with one or more lectures by researchers, that address the conceptual knowledge needed.
the afternoon sessions will be devoted to the hands-on training of skills, following the library carpentry model as closely as possible.
by having researchers provide the lecture sessions, we hope to fuel the enthusiasm of the librarians with the inspiration of direct contact with researchers and to provide access to a network within and across universities.
with these clinics, we hope to initiate a stream of dh activities in dutch universities, making access to support easier for new digital scholars.

australian children suffering from iodine deficiency
thursday, february 23, 2006
almost half of all australian primary school children are mild to moderately iodine deficient, researchers say.
a new study documenting iodine nutritional status in australian school children has revealed many are not getting enough iodine - which can lead to mental and growth retardation.
the report's authors say iodine deficiency is "the sleeper health issue in australia", and potentially a very serious one.
the results of the australian national iodine nutrition study published in the medical journal of australia this week, revealed that children in mainland australia are borderline iodine deficient.
the report has prompted calls for all edible salt to be iodised.
they say adding the mineral to salt is the simplest and most effective method of preventing iodine deficiency disorders.

australian children suffering from iodine deficiency thursday, february 23, 2006 almost half of all australian primary school children are mild to moderately iodine deficient, researchers say.
a new study documenting iodine nutritional status in australian school children has revealed many are not getting enough iodine - which can lead to mental and growth retardation.
the report's authors say iodine deficiency is "the sleeper health issue in australia", and potentially a very serious one.
the results of the australian national iodine nutrition study published in the medical journal of australia this week, revealed that children in mainland australia are borderline iodine deficient.
the report has prompted calls for all edible salt to be iodised.
they say adding the mineral to salt is the simplest and most effective method of preventing iodine deficiency disorders.

old athens
the first pre-historic settlements was constructed in 3000 bc around the hill of acropolis.
the legend says that the king of athens, theseus unified the ten tribes of early athens into one kingdom (c. 1230 bc).
this process of synoikismos - bringing together in one home - created the largest and wealthiest state on the greek mainland, but it also created a larger class of people excluded from political life by the nobility.
by the 7th century bc, social unrest had become widespread, and the areopagus appointed draco to draft a strict new law code (hence "draconian").
when this failed, they appointed solon, with a mandate to create a new constitution (594).
this was the great beginning of a new social revolution, which was the result of the democracy under clisthenes (508 bc).
during the middle ages, athens experienced a decline, but re-emerged under byzantian rule.
athens was thriving and prosperous during the crusades, actually benefiting from the italian trade during this period.

tenured and tenure-track university faculty play a special role in determining the speed and direction of scientific progress, both directly through their research and indirectly through their training of new researchers.
past studies establish that each of these efforts is strongly and positively influenced through various forms of faculty diversity, including ethnic, racial, and gender diversity.
as an example, research shows that greater diversity within a community or group can lead to improved critical thinking [1] and more creative solutions to complex tasks [2, 3] by pairing together individuals with unique skillsets and perspectives that complement and often augment the abilities of their peers.
additionally, diversity has been shown to produce more supportive social climates and effective learning environments [4], which can facilitate the mentoring of young scientists.
despite these positive effects, however, quantifying the impact of diversity in science remains exceedingly difficult, due in large part to a lack of comprehensive data about the scientific workforce.
measuring the composition and dynamics of a scientific workforce, particularly in a rapidly expanding field like computer science, is a crucial first step toward understanding how scholarly research is conducted and how it might be enhanced.
for many scientific fields, however, there is no central listing of all tenure-track faculty, making it difficult to define a rigorous sample frame for analysis.
further, rates of adoption of services like googlescholar and researchgate vary within, and across disciplines.
for instance, gender representation in computing is an important issue with broad implications [5], but without a full census of computing faculty, the degree of inequality and its possible sources are difficult to establish [6].

1. introduction
mutation-based testing [1] is a test technique that involves artificially introducing errors into a system under test (sut).
a mutant is a copy of the system in which a change has been done that, in most cases, will lead to a behaviour different than expected.
the different mutants are generated automatically by the application of mutation operators.
in the state of the art, we have found mutation operators, both general purpose and specific to different technologies, languages and paradigms [2-9].
however, these operators are not adequate when trying to test software features associated with specific domains.
in this article, we propose mutation operators specific to the domain of geographic information systems (gis) applications.
these operators reproduce programming errors that are litely to occur during the development of this type of applications.
in addition, we present the implementation of these operators and as proof of concept we apply these operators to two real-world gis applications and we generate the mutants.

for his services his second son james, brigadier of the russian army, was created count of the holy roman empire in 1701.

nida has been a pioneer in the fields of translation theory and linguistics.
his ph.d. dissertation, a synopsis of english syntax, was the first full-scale analysis of a major language according to the "immediate-constituent" theory.
his textbook morphology: the descriptive analysis of words was one of the major works of american structuralism.
it remained the only thorough introduction to the field for decades and is still valuable for its many examples and exercises.
his most notable contribution to translation theory is dynamic equivalence, also known as functional equivalence.
for more information, see "dynamic and formal equivalence."
nida also developed the componential analysis technique, which split words into their components to help determine equivalence in translation (e.g. "bachelor" = male + unmarried).
this is, perhaps, not the best example of the technique, though it is the most well-known.
nida's dynamic-equivalence theory is often held in opposition to the views of philologists who maintain that an understanding of the source text (st) can be achieved by assessing the inter-animation of words on the page, and that meaning is self-contained within the text (i.e. much more focused on achieving semantic equivalence).

i just wanted to know if you had any thoughts on recent nato actions and the protests coming up at the 60th nato conference, i know you're speaking at the counter-conference.
could be i give so many talks i can't remember.
on the nato conference, well i mean the obvious question is why should nato exist?
in fact you can ask questions about why it should ever have existed, but now why should it exist.
i mean the theory was, whether you believe it or not, that it would be a defensive alliance against potential soviet aggression, that's the basic doctrine.
well there's no defense against soviet aggression, so whether you believe that doctrine or not that's gone.
when the soviet union collapsed there had been an agreement, a recent agreement, between gorbachev and the u.s government and the first bush administration.
the agreement was that gorbachev agreed to a quite remarkable concession: he agreed to let a united germany join the nato military alliance.
now it is remarkable in the light of history, the history of the past century, germany alone had virtually destroyed russia, twice, and germany backed by a hostile military alliance, centered in the most phenomenal military power in history, that's a real threat.

to "route out" in scientology jargon refers to the member who wishes to leave proceeding through a set of interrogative exit interviews while attached to the scientology device called the e-meter.
according to rathbun, a detective for the los angeles sheriff's office was provided with material from scientology to build a case against montalvo.
rathbun stated,
"daniel was picked up by an investigator in a black car with blacked out windows.
instead of being taken to a hotel, where he could route out as promised, he was taken to the century city towers.
he was deposited in an office on the 33rd floor where a pricy church lawyer interrogated him for two hours."
rathbun asserted that scientology officials, "... plied the sheriff's detective with a grand conspiracy theory, characterizing me as the 'anti-christ' of the church of scientology. ... the next thing daniel knows he's in a cell where he sat for the next 30 hours."
steve whitmore, a representative for the la sheriff's office, told la weekly in a statement that the case involving montalvo was being dealt with as charges relating to grand theft.
whitmore stated montalvo left scientology-related employment in los angeles on september 24.
on september 29, scientology officials went to the east los angeles sheriff's station where they claimed montalvo allegedly left the organization with computer hard drives.

according to the saudi interior ministry over 345 muslim pilgrims have been killed in a stampede during the annual hajj pilgrimage near mecca, saudi arabia.
the stampede at islam's most holy site happened at jamarat bridge, during an event where pebbles are thrown at a pillar to represent the stoning of satan as part of the final rites of the hajj.
the stampede began when luggage from a bus tripped pilgrims at the eastern end of the wall, causing a bottleneck.
those who were tripped were then crushed by the wave of people behind them.

like most u.s. cities, cleveland proper began to lose population to suburban areas in the 1960s and 1970s.
however, in the mid-1980s, cleveland earned the nickname the "comeback city" as the urban core experienced a dramatic revitalization process that continues today.
as its "comeback" has continued, the official moniker is now the new american city as cleveland has rightfully earned the reputation as a model of effective public-private partnership for urban planning.
despite the common perception that cleveland is an industrial town, just beyond the automotive and steel plants, a clean and beautiful downtown rises at the mouth of the cuyahoga river on the southern shore of lake erie (often marvelled over by visitors who are surprised you can't see the other side, i.e., canada).
like other cities in the so-called "rust belt", cleveland has endured growing pains as it makes its transition from a manufacturing-based economy.
while cleveland continues to play a leading role in building the u.s. industrial base, it has also developed economic prowess in the fields of health care, law, finance, insurance, real estate development, and professional services.
rock and roll hall of fame and museum
another thing non-locals don't often realize is that cleveland's long history of industrial wealth has left it chock full of cultural riches as well as the beginnings of a "sustainable city" movement.
serving as a global model for urban rebirth, cleveland has been named one of the top 10 international visitor hotspots by travel and leisure magazine.
for decades, the city has boasted of: a "big five" orchestra (the cleveland orchestra), the second largest performing arts center in the u.s. (playhouse square center), a world-renowned art museum (the cleveland museum of art), the nation's first health museum (healthspace cleveland), r&d hub of the aerospace and aviation industry (the nasa glenn research & visitors center) and a number of other first-rate attractions (too many to mention here - read on).

like most u.s. cities, cleveland proper began to lose population to suburban areas in the 1960s and 1970s.
however, in the mid-1980s, cleveland earned the nickname the "comeback city" as the urban core experienced a dramatic revitalization process that continues today.
as its "comeback" has continued, the official moniker is now the new american city as cleveland has rightfully earned the reputation as a model of effective public-private partnership for urban planning.

rather surprised, i said yes, when he produced a thing like calipers and got the dimensions back and front and every way, taking notes carefully.
he was an unshaven little man in a threadbare coat like a gaberdine, with his feet in slippers, and i thought him a harmless fool.

such actions are mainly single-country or single-subject actions (i.e. not eligible under pericles) and are systematically coordinated with pericles by the competent service in the commission in coordination with member states.
in addition to their awareness and training content, the pericles actions have led to a number of structural and other improvements in member sates and in third countries.
among others, national central offices for the fight against counterfeiting were created in several countries;
two pericles seminars assisted the (then) acceding countries in their efforts to apply the acquis in the specific area;
a code of conduct was drawn with respect to press and communication issues;
in line with the above analysis and in the light of the conclusions of the evaluator of pericles, this communication is accompanied by a proposal for the adaptation and continuation of pericles.
in line with article 13 of council decision of 17 december 2001 establishing an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (the ' pericles' programme) and based on the pericles evaluation report of 30 november 2004, it is proposed that the council decision be extended and amended.

far from improving citizens' access to health care, weak ip protections are exacerbating india's formidable health-care challenges.

the reality is that ip protection is an economic engine that developing-country citizens should not have to forego.
the banks that ate the economy.
london - bank of england governor mark carney surprised his audience at a conference late last year by speculating that banking assets in london could grow to more than nine times britain's gdp by 2050.
his forecast represented a simple extrapolation of two trends:
continued financial deepening worldwide (that is, faster growth of financial assets than of the real economy), and london's maintenance of its share of the global financial business.
these may be reasonable assumptions, but the estimate was deeply unsettling to many.
hosting a huge financial center, with outsize domestic banks, can be costly to taxpayers.

china's export-led growth miracle would not have started in the 1980's without the american consumer.
the us, for its part, relied on cheap goods made in china to stretch hard-pressed consumers' purchasing power.
it also became dependent on china's savings surplus to finance its own savings shortfall (the world's largest), and took advantage of china's voracious demand for us treasury securities to help fund massive budget deficits and subsidize low domestic interest rates.
frictions between the two partners have developed over a wide range of issues, including trade, the renminbi's exchange rate, regional security, intellectual property, and cyber attacks, among others.
and, just as a psychologist would predict, one of the partners, china, has decided to go its own way.
china's rebalancing will enable it to absorb its surplus savings, which will be put to work building a social safety net and boosting chinese households' wherewithal.
as a result, china will no longer be inclined to lend its capital to the us.
for a growth-starved us economy, the transformation of its codependent partner could well be a fork in the road.
one path is quite risky:
the other path holds great opportunity:

little evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death, and shakeshafte was a common name in the lancashire area.
by then, he was sufficiently well known in london to be attacked in print by the playwright robert greene in his groats-worth of wit:
... there is an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his tiger's heart wrapped in a player's hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you:
and being an absolute johannes factotum, is in his own conceit the only shake-scene in a country.
scholars differ on the exact meaning of these words, but most agree that greene is accusing shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match university-educated writers such as christopher marlowe, thomas nashe and greene himself (the "university wits").
the italicised phrase parodying the line "oh, tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide" from shakespeare's henry vi, part 3, along with the pun "shake-scene", identifies shakespeare as greene's target.
here johannes factotum - "jack of all trades" - means a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others, rather than the more common "universal genius".
greene's attack is the earliest surviving mention of shakespeare's career in the theatre.
biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before greene's remarks.
from 1594, shakespeare's plays were performed by only the lord chamberlain's men, a company owned by a group of players, including shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in london.

many of the plays had already appeared in quarto versions - flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves.
no evidence suggests that shakespeare approved these editions, which the first folio describes as "stol'n and surreptitious copies".
alfred pollard termed some of them "bad quartos" because of their adapted, paraphrased or garbled texts, which may in places have been reconstructed from memory.
where several versions of a play survive, each differs from the other.
the differences may stem from copying or printing errors, from notes by actors or audience members, or from shakespeare's own papers.
in some cases, for example hamlet, troilus and cressida and othello, shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions.
in the case of king lear, however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the 1623 folio version is so different from the 1608 quarto, that the oxford shakespeare prints them both, arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion.
in 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of plague, shakespeare published two narrative poems on erotic themes, venus and adonis and the rape of lucrece.
in venus and adonis, an innocent adonis rejects the sexual advances of venus;
while in the rape of lucrece, the virtuous wife lucrece is raped by the lustful tarquin.
